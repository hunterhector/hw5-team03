Fraering*√âcole Polytechnique F√©d√©rale de Lausanne, Brain Mind Institute, Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Biology of Alzheimer's Disease, Lausanne, SwitzerlandAbstract Top BackgroundMutations linked to early onset, familial forms of Alzheimer's disease (FAD) are found most frequently in PSEN1, the gene encoding presenilin-1 (PS1). Together with nicastrin (NCT), anterior pharynx-defective protein 1 (APH1), and presenilin enhancer 2 (PEN2), the catalytic subunit PS1 constitutes the core of the Œ≥-secretase complex and contributes to the proteolysis of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) into amyloid-beta (AŒ≤) peptides. Although there is a growing consensus that FAD-linked PS1 mutations affect AŒ≤ production by enhancing the AŒ≤1‚Äì42/AŒ≤1‚Äì40 ratio, it remains unclear whether and how they affect the generation of APP intracellular domain (AICD). Moreover, controversy exists as to how PS1 mutations exert their effects in different experimental systems, by either increasing AŒ≤1‚Äì42 production, decreasing AŒ≤1‚Äì40 production, or both. Because it could be explained by the heterogeneity in the composition of Œ≥-secretase, we purified to homogeneity complexes made of human NCT, APH1aL, PEN2, and the pathogenic PS1 mutants L166P, ŒîE9, or P436Q.Methodology/Principal FindingsWe took advantage of a mouse embryonic fibroblast cell line lacking PS1 and PS2 to generate different stable cell lines overexpressing human Œ≥-secretase complexes with different FAD-linked PS1 mutations. A multi-step affinity purification procedure was used to isolate semi-purified or highly purified Œ≥-secretase complexes. The functional characterization of these complexes revealed that all PS1 FAD-linked mutations caused a loss of Œ≥-secretase activity phenotype, in terms of AŒ≤1‚Äì40, AŒ≤1‚Äì42 and APP intracellular domain productions in vitro.Conclusion/SignificanceOur data support the view that PS1 mutations lead to a strong Œ≥-secretase loss-of-function phenotype and an increased AŒ≤1‚Äì42/AŒ≤1‚Äì40 ratio, two mechanisms that are potentially involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.Citation: Cacquevel M, Aeschbach L, Houacine J, Fraering PC (2012) Alzheimer's Disease-Linked Mutations in Presenilin-1 Result in a Drastic Loss of Activity in Purified Œ≥-Secretase Complexes.

PSEN1 and PSEN2 encode transmembrane proteins PS1 and PS2, respectively, that constitute the catalytic core of Œ≥-secretase, the founding member of an emerging class of unconventional, Intramembrane-Cleaving Proteases (I-CLiPs) [3]. Active Œ≥-secretase is a multiprotein complex composed of PS1 or PS2 together with nicastrin (NCT), the anterior pharynx-defective protein 1 (APH1), and the presenilin enhancer 2 (PEN2). Experimental evidence such as the binding of transition-state analogue Œ≥-secretase inhibitors to PS1 [4], as well as the abolishment of Œ≥-secretase activity when PS1 lacks the aspartate residues critical for proteolysis [4], [5], [6], have confirmed that presenilins harbour the active site of the enzymatic complex.PS1 and PS2 play fundamental roles in cell signalling as part of the Œ≥-secretase complex. The latter cleaves numerous type-I membrane proteins in their transmembrane domain [7], releasing their corresponding intracellular domains, which are capable of influencing gene expression. For some substrates like NOTCH1 or ERBB4, the Œ≥-secretase cleavage is essential for their biological function, whereas for other substrates like DCC or NEUREXIN-3Œ≤ [8], the possible role of the cleavage in signalling events has not been formally established (see [9] for a review). The amyloid precursor protein (APP) is processed by the successive actions of Œ≤-secretase (BACE1) and Œ≥-secretase, generating amyloid-beta peptides (AŒ≤) of different lengths, ranging from 37 to 46 amino acids [10]. Cleavage of the APP C-terminal fragments (APP-CTFs) by Œ≥-secretase also releases the APP intracellular domain (AICD), which has been recently involved in the regulation of brain ApoE expression, a major genetic determinant of AD, and in cholesterol metabolism [11]. In addition, PS1 has been shown to interact with a growing list of proteins that modulate Œ≥-secretase activity [9], [12], [13], [14].In a pathological context, 185 missense mutations in PSEN1 and 13 mutations in PSEN2 have been identified and found to be associated with FAD (www.molgen.ua.ac.be/ADMutations). It was initially suggested that such mutations lead to a toxic gain of function because they are associated with a relative increased production of longer and more hydrophobic AŒ≤ species, mainly AŒ≤1‚Äì42, that accumulate and aggregate early in the course of thedisease [15], [16]. Similar phenotypes have been observed by independent groups in cell-based studies performed with different mammalian cell lines [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22]. Despite this growing consensus, the above-mentioned studies provided conflicting results regarding the relative proportions of AŒ≤42, AŒ≤40, and AICD resulting from the PSEN mutations. On one hand, a gain-of-function phenotype was suggested due to the observed increase in AŒ≤42 production, accompanied or not with reduced AŒ≤40 production, thereby leading to an increased AŒ≤42/AŒ≤40 ratio. On the other hand, reduced AICD production suggested a loss-of-function phenotype [20]. Differences in the methodologies and cell types used to assess the effects of PSEN mutations on AŒ≤ and AICD productions can explain this controversy as to how PS mutations exert their effects. For example, endogenous PS has been suggested to affect such analysis, as the FAD-linked PSEN1 mutations led to a decrease in the total amount of AŒ≤ generated in PS1 and PS2 double knockout cells [23]. Next, it has been reported that Œ≥-secretase complexes are heterogeneous in composition (with two PS genes and three APH1 isoforms, six combinations of Œ≥-secretase are possible), with distinct functional properties influencing the relative amount of AŒ≤ species generated [24]. In order to investigate the biochemical and functional properties of Œ≥-secretase in cell-free systems, we and others have recently purified this enzymatic complex to homogeneity [25], [26], [27]. In particular, protocols for the high-grade purification of proteolytically active Œ≥-secretase constituted of NCT, APH1aL, PEN2 and wild-type PS1 [26], [27] allowed the reconstitution of 3D structures at 15 √Ö and 12 √Ö resolution by EM and cryo-EM and gave new insights on the structure and activity of the enzyme [28], [29]. However, these studies were exclusively focused on the wild-type PS1. Here, we report for the first time the functional characterization of highly purified and homogenous human Œ≥-secretase particles carrying different FAD-linked PS1 mutants. Our biochemical and functional findings strongly suggest that pathogenic mutations in PSEN1 cause a loss of Œ≥-secretase activity.Results Top Generation, selection and characterization of stable cell lines overexpressing Œ≥-secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 mutantsIn order to facilitate high-grade purification of homogenous human Œ≥-secretase complexes containing different PS1 variants, we took advantage of a previously generated mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cell line that lacks the two presenilins (PS1/2‚àí/‚àí) [30], [31]. Our global strategy consisted in producing stable cell lines, on a PS1/2‚àí/‚àí background, that overexpress tagged versions of the three human Œ≥-secretase subunits NCT, APH1 and PEN2 together with different variants of human PS1, and to purify the different human Œ≥-secretase complexes by three sequential affinity purification steps. This strategy allowed us to exclude a possible co-purification of mouse Œ≥-secretase components. First, a parental cell line was generated by co-transducing lentiviral vectors of human NCT-V5 (hNCT-V5), human APH1aL-HA (hAPH1aL-HA) and human Flag-PEN2 (Flag-hPEN2) into MEF PS1/2‚àí/‚àí. Lentivectors are stably integrated into the cell genome and allow the generation of cell lines overexpressing multiple genes in a short period of time. Next, the clone expressing the highest levels of all three recombinant proteins was selected (designated Œ≥ - PS1/2) and used as the parental cell line that was further transduced with lentivectors carrying the following different human PS1 variants: PS1-WT, three dominant-negative forms of PS1 that lack the crucial, catalytic site aspartate residues (D257A, D385A, and both D257A/D385A referred to as DDAA later in the article), and three FAD-linked PS1 mutants (L166P, ŒîE9 and P436Q, with mean disease onset at 24 years, 45.5 years and 28.3 years, respectively).For each PS1 variant, two individual clones were selected based on the expression levels of the recombinant proteins, and extensively characterized (Figure 1). To distinguish those cell lines overexpressing all Œ≥-sectease components from wild-type MEFs, they are collectively designated Œ≥-MEFs. As shown in Figure 1A, the analysis of total protein extracts confirmed that PS is required for the maturation of NCT and the stability of PEN2 [23], [32]. As expected, and when compared to the parental Œ≥- PS1/2 cell line, higher levels of the mature form of NCT were observed in all PS1-overexpressing clones. In contrast to PEN2, APH1aL levels were relatively similar in all PS1 clones and the parental cell line. Indeed, and as previously reported [23], [32], PEN2 levels were higher in the clones overexpressing WT PS1 and FAD-linked PS1 mutants, and to a lesser extent in the clones overexpressing the dominant negative forms of PS1. Interestingly, PEN2 migrated on the gel as an apparent double band, possibly reflecting a post-translational modification. Different patterns of PS1 expression and autoproteolysis were observed in the different clones. First, and in sharp contrast to the other clones, those expressing PS1-WT or PS1-L166P displayed higher levels of PS1-NTF and PS1-CTF fragments compared with full-length PS1 (PS1-FL; Figure 1A). As estimated by densitometry, the NTF fragments of PS1-WT and PS1-L166P account for 87¬±2% and 79¬±7% of total PS1 (PS1-NTF+PS1-FL), respectively. Next, the PS1-ŒîE9 clones did not show any detectable NTF or CTF fragments, as previously described [33], while P436Q and the three dominant negative variants of PS1 were characterized by low levels of PS1-NTF and PS1-CTF fragments, suggesting that these variants were less prone to endoproteolysis.thumbnailFigure 1. Generation of stable cell lines overexpressing all human Œ≥-secretase components with FAD-linked PS1 variants.MEF PS1/2‚àí/‚àí were stably co-transduced with lentiviral vectors carrying genes encoding hNCT-V5, Flag-hPEN2, hAPH1aL-HA and clones were isolated by limiting dilution to generate a cell line, designated as Œ≥- PS1/2, that overexpresses high amount of the three subunits. Œ≥- PS1/2 MEFs were further transduced with hPS1 variants harbouring FAD-linked mutations or mutations in the catalytic aspartate residue(s), or PS1-WT, and cloned. Each clone, derived form the Œ≥- PS1/2, was conveniently named according to the mutation present in PS1 preceded by the symbol Œ≥ and followed by the number of the clone (Œ≥-MEF) in order to distinguish them from wild-type MEF (WT MEF) and MEF PS1/2‚àí/‚àí. Two clones per Œ≥-secretase variant were selected for characterization. (A‚ÄìB) Whole cell protein extracts of the different cell lines were prepared in 1% NP40-HEPES buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE on 4‚Äì12% Bis-Tris or 12% Tris-Glycine gels and analysed by immunostaining to detect the Œ≥-secretase core components NCT (NCT164), PS1 (NTF, MAB1563; CTF; MAB5232), APH1aL-HA (3F10), and Flag-PEN2 (M2) (A), and endogenous APP (A8717) (B). Œ≤-Actin was used as a loading control. Each lane represents one selected clone. CTF: C-terminal fragment, FL: full-length, im.: immature NCT; m.: mature NCT, N: N-glycosylated, NTF: N-terminal fragment, O: O-glycosylated.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0035133.g001 We next investigated the effects of PSEN1 mutations on the processing of endogenous APP. As expected, and as indicated by increased levels of intracellular APP-CTFs (a common characteristic among known substrates in response to Œ≥-secretase pharmacological inhibition), the activity of Œ≥-secretase was significantly altered in the PS deficient parental Œ≥ - PS1/2 cell line as well as in all clones expressing dominant negative forms of PS1 (Figure 1B). In the clones expressing PS1-WT, APP-CTFs were almost undetectable due to high Œ≥-secretase activity, while clones expressing PS1-L166P or PS1-P436Q displayed APP-CTF accumulation. In PS1-ŒîE9 clones, a mild APP-CTF accumulation was observed (Figure 1B). Although a poor recovery of Œ≥-secretase activity for the PS1-L166P and a comparatively better performance of PS1-ŒîE9 have been reported by others under similar experimental conditions [23], the potential of PS1-P436Q mutation to restore the processing of endogenous APP-CTFs has never been assessed [34], [35]. Importantly, all observations described above for the cells overexpressing simultaneously hNCT-V5, hAPH1aL-HA, Flag-hPEN2 and the different PS1 variants are very consistent with those made in MEF PS1/2‚àí/‚àí cells overexpressing only the PS1 variants, in the absence of the other Œ≥-secretase components (cf. Figure S1A). These data suggest that the effect of FAD mutations in PS1 on APP-CTFs accumulation was similar in presence or absence of other human components of the Œ≥-secretase.Next, we further investigated the effect of PS1 variants on the cellular production/secretion of AŒ≤ species. For this purpose, and as described elsewhere [36], we used an APP-based Œ≥-secretase substrate with a Flag tag at its C-terminus (SPA4CT-Flag). This substrate was transduced in the above-described Œ≥-secretase overexpressing stable cell lines (Œ≥-MEFs) as well as in wild-type MEFs, and APP-CTFs and AŒ≤ levels were measured in cell lysate and cell media, respectively (Figure 2). Under these conditions, the overexpression of SPA4CT-Flag led to an accumulation of two bands corresponding to the exogenous substrate, associated with a concomitant decrease of endogenous APP-CTFs levels (Figure 2A and Figure S2). As estimated by ELISA, a three-fold increase in AŒ≤1‚Äì40 and AŒ≤1‚Äì42 levels was observed in the cell culture media of cell lines overexpressing human Œ≥-secretase (Œ≥-MEF WT), in comparison to untransduced WT MEFs (Figure 2B). Also, the average AŒ≤1‚Äì42/AŒ≤1‚Äì40 ratios were not significantly different in those cell lines (Mean ¬± SD: Œ≥-MEF WT#5: 0.30¬±0.01; Œ≥-MEF WT#8: 0.29¬±0.01; WT MEF: 0.19¬±0.06). Next, overexpression of SPA4CT-Flag in Œ≥-MEFs led to the pronounced intracellular accumulation of APP-CTFs in cells overexpressing the PS1 aspartate mutants (Figure 2C), and to the secretion in the cell culture media of different AŒ≤ levels as measured by ELISA (Figure 2D). First, only traces of both AŒ≤1‚Äì40 and AŒ≤1‚Äì42 were detected in Œ≥-MEFs overexpressing PS1 with aspartate mutants. Next, Œ≥-MEFs overexpressing PS1 with FAD-linked mutations displayed a pronounced variability in AŒ≤ levels when compared to the wild-type clones. Overall, the average AŒ≤1‚Äì40 levels were decreased in these cell lines (Mean of two clones in pg/mL ¬± SD: WT: 224.6¬±0.1, L166P: 84.3¬±34.2, ŒîE9: 167.2¬±40.7, P436Q: 82.8¬±74.7), while the AŒ≤1‚Äì42 levels were increased (Mean of two clones in pg/mL ¬± SD: WT: 69.9¬±7.9, L166P: 310.7¬±81.0, ŒîE9: 94.4¬±18.5, P436Q: 141.1¬±98.5). Consistent with previously reported data, the AŒ≤1‚Äì42/AŒ≤1‚Äì40 ratios were increased in all Œ≥-MEF clones overexpressing PS1 with FAD-linked mutations (Figure 2D) (Mean of two clones pg/mL ¬± SD: WT: 0.31¬±0.03, L166P: 3.8¬±0.58, ŒîE9: 0.6¬±0.03, P436Q: 2.0¬±0.59).thumbnailFigure 2. AŒ≤ production in cell lines overexpressing human Œ≥-secretase components with FAD-linked PS1 variants.WT MEF, Œ≥-MEF and Œ≥ - PS1/2 were transduced with an APP-based substrate corresponding to the 99 C-terminal residues of human APP fused to the APP signal peptide in N-terminus (SPA4CT [36]) and a Flag Tag in C-terminus. Cell proteins were extracted in 1% NP40-HEPES buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE on 12% Tris-Glycine gels and analysed by immunostaining with an antibody targeting the C-terminal part of APP (A8717) (A, C). AŒ≤1‚Äì40 and AŒ≤1‚Äì42 levels were also measured in the corresponding cell culture media (B, D). Data corresponds to three independent experiments (Mean ¬± SEM).doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0035133.g002 FAD-linked PS1 mutations alter the activity of semi-purified Œ≥-secretase complexesWe next assessed the activity of Œ≥-secretase with FAD-linked PS1 mutations in microsomal extracts of Œ≥-MEFs. Membrane protein extracts were prepared and Œ≥-secretase activity was assayed on an exogenous recombinant APP-based substrate consisting of the C-terminal 99 amino acid residues of APP, and referred to as C100-Flag (Figure 3A). The generation of the cleavage product AICD-Flag was detected by Western blot analysis and measured by densitometry. As shown in Figure 3A, the levels of AICD-Flag generated from the PS1-L166P and PS1-ŒîE9 clones accounted for 42¬±1% and 13¬±6% of that in the PS1-WT clones, respectively. AICD-Flag was undetectable in the clones expressing PS1-P436Q as well as in the three dominant negative aspartate PS1 variants. Similar results were observed in MEF PS1/2‚àí/‚àí cells overexpressing only the PS1 variants, in the absence of the other human Œ≥-secretase components (Figure S1B).thumbnailFigure 3. Enzymatic activity of partially purified Œ≥-secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 mutants.(A) Œ≥-Secretase activity assays performed with Œ≥-MEF and Œ≥ - PS1/2 microsomal extracts prepared in 1% CHAPSO-HEPES buffer. Equal protein levels from the different extracts were diluted to 0.25% CHAPSO-HEPES buffer and incubated for 4 h at 37¬∞C with lipids and 1 ¬µM of recombinant human APP-based substrate (C100-Flag). Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunostained with anti-Flag (M2) or anti-PS1 (MAB1563). The relative amounts of AICD-Flag generated in the reactions, reflecting Œ≥-secretase activity, were estimated by densitometry. PS1 immunostaining was used to assess the amount of input material. (B) Equal amounts of microsomal proteins were immunoprecipitated overnight at 4¬∞C with either anti-Flag M2 or anti-HA affinity resins, and submitted to a C100-His assay according to the same protocol as in (A). Protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and analysed by immunostaining for Œ≥-secretase subunits ((NCT164 (NCT), MAB1563 (PS1-NTF), or UD1 (PEN2)). AICD-His cleavage products were immunostained with an anti-APP-CTF antibody (A8717). *Indicates a non-specific band corresponding to the IgG light chains. (C) AŒ≤1‚Äì40 and AŒ≤1‚Äì42 were quantified by sandwich ELISA and represented in pg/mL (left Y-axis) or in percentage (right Y-axis) of the mean of AŒ≤1‚Äì40 levels generated by the two wild-type clones. AŒ≤1‚Äì42/AŒ≤1‚Äì40 ratios are indicated on the top of the bars. The results were confirmed in three independent experiments and a representative dataset is shown.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0035133.g003 We next performed activity assays under semi-purified conditions. To do so, Œ≥-secretase complexes from the different clones were co-immunoprecipitated from microsomal extracts and their activities were assayed in vitro with the C100-His substrate. Two immunoprecipitation protocols using two affinity resins (anti-Flag M2 and anti-HA 3F10, targeting respectively Flag-PEN2 and APH1aL-HA) were compared to exclude a possible heterogeneity of Œ≥-secretase complexes potentially generated under such conditions. As shown in Figure 3B, the anti-Flag and anti-HA resins immunoprecipitated similar levels of NCT, PS1 and PEN2 and the activity of the Œ≥-secretase complexes was similar regardless of the affinity resins used (Figures 3B). In agreement with the assays performed using microsomal extracts (Figure 3A), those performed with semi-purified complexes revealed that FAD-linked mutants drastically reduced AICD generation, when compared to PS1-WT (Figure 3B). Furthermore, levels of AŒ≤1‚Äì40 produced from PS1-L166P, PS1-ŒîE9 and P436Q variants fell respectively to ~6%, ~1.5% and ~0.5%, when compared to these produced from PS1-WT Œ≥-secretase. Following the same tendency, AŒ≤1‚Äì42 levels generated from PS1-L166P, PS1-ŒîE9 and PS1-P436Q Œ≥-secretase variants were respectively estimated to ~20%, ~5% and ~3% of these produced with PS1-WT-containing complexes. The AŒ≤1-42/AŒ≤1‚Äì40 ratio measured for WT Œ≥-MEFs was consistent with our cell-based data (compare Figures 2D and 3C), validating our in vitro experimental conditions. Interestingly, an overall AŒ≤1‚Äì42/AŒ≤1‚Äì40 ratio of ~1 was estimated for all PS1 mutants, with the exception of P436Q#4 (~2). However, in the latter, the ratio may have been overestimated because the AŒ≤1‚Äì40 levels measured were at the detection limit. This similarity in the AŒ≤1‚Äì42/AŒ≤1‚Äì40 ratios generated by the different mutantshas, to the best of our knowledge, never been observed in previous studies.Highly purified Œ≥-secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 mutants display a loss-of-function phenotypeIn order to further investigate how PS1 variants affect APP-CTF cleavage and to validate our observations performed in semi-purified conditions, we purified to homogeneity Œ≥-secretase complexes from the selected clones described in Figure 1. The purification process (described in details under Materials &amp; Methods and depicted in Figure 4A) involved three sequential affinity purifications starting from microsomal extracts. Since all cell lines were generated on a PS knockout background, this strategy allowed us to purify exclusively and selectively Œ≥-secretase complexes made of human components. As highlighted in Figure 4B, our protocol led to the production of stable, high molecular weight Œ≥-secretase complexes (HMWCs) with an apparent molecular mass on Blue Native (BN)-PAGE of ~350 kDa, which is consistent with previous reports [26], [27], [37]. The silver stained particles on the BN gel confirmed the high purity of these complexes (Figure 4B, upper panel), for which the identity was established by cross-reactivity with antibodies specific to NCT and PS1 (Figure 4B, lower panels). As the main goal of this experiment was to compare the efficacy of the different Œ≥-secretase complexes to process APP-based substrates, it is important to note that the final yields of the complexes purified from the different clones were very similar (Figure 4B), thus facilitating further comparative analyses. The immunoblot analysis of the purified complexes (Figure 4C) confirmed the presence of all core components (NCT-V5, APH1aL-HA, Flag-PEN2 and PS1) and globally recapitulates the maturation processes observed in the Figure 1. Interestingly, the relative PS1-NTF/CTF to PS1-FL ratios in the purified Œ≥-secretase complexes containing the three PS1 dominant-negative or the PS1-P436Q variants were higher than those estimated in the whole cell extracts before purification (Figure 1A), indicating that endoproteolysis of PS1 was not completely abolished by these mutations. To assess how FAD-linked mutations in PS1 affect Œ≥-secretase activity in these purified complexes, we performed in vitro assays by using C100-Flag substrate (Figure 3A) and equal amounts of the different purified complexes, immediately after the purification to avoid freezing/thawing cycles that might affect enzymatic activity. As shown in Figure 5A, Œ≥-secretase activity based on AICD-Flag production was easily detected in complexes purified from the two PS1-WT clones. This is in sharp contrast to the other purified complexes that did not generate detectable AICD under our experimental conditions (Figure 5A). Next, sandwich ELISAs directed against AŒ≤1‚Äì40 and AŒ≤1‚Äì42 were performed in order to further characterize the specific activity of the purified complexes. Reflecting the levels of AICD and considering the detection limits of our sandwich ELISA, the production of both AŒ≤ species by Œ≥-secretase complexes containing PS1-WT was at least 10-fold higher than in complexes with the FAD-linked or dominant-negative PS1 variants (Figure 5B). The AŒ≤1‚Äì42/AŒ≤1‚Äì40 ratio measured in PS1-WT Œ≥-secretase complexes (~0.22) was similar to that previously reported [26], [27], thus excluding a possible qualitative alteration of Œ≥-secretase activity with this protocol. Together, our results strongly support the hypothesis that the pathogenic L166P, ŒîE9, and P436Q mutations in PSEN1 cause a drastic loss (at least 90% as estimated by ELISA) of Œ≥-secretase activity.thumbnailFigure 4. High-grade purification of human Œ≥-secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 mutants.(A) Schematic representation of the Œ≥-secretase purification process. Briefly, Presenilin double-knockout MEFs were used to first generate cell lines that stably overexpress human Œ≥-secretase complexes containing different PS1 variants. Next, these cell lines were used for a multi-step purification procedure as described in the material and methods. (B) Blue-Native PAGE analysis of purified Œ≥-secretase complexes made of different PS1 variants. Equal volumes of the different purified Œ≥-secretase preparations were separated by native-PAGE on a 4‚Äì16% Bis-Tris gel, and stained with silver nitrate (top panel), or immunostained for NCT (NCT164, middle panel) or PS1-NTF (ab10281, bottom panel) as indicated. Œ≥-Secretase complexes appeared on the gel as high molecular weight complexes (HMWCs) of ~350 kDa. Note that the levels of HMWCs were similar for all clones. (C) Equal volumes of purified Œ≥-secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 mutants were separated under denaturing conditions (SDS-PAGE) and immunostained with anti-NCT (NCT164), anti-PS1-NTF (MAB1563), anti-PS1-CTF (MAB5232), anti-HA (3F10), or anti-Flag (M2) antibodies. Two independent purifications were performed on each clone with similar results. A representative dataset is shown.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0035133.g004 thumbnailFigure 5. Enzymatic activity of highly purified Œ≥-secretase complexes with FAD-linked or aspartate PS1 mutants.Equal amounts of the different purified Œ≥-secretase preparations characterized in Figure 4 were tested for activity on C100-Flag, as described in Figure 3. The resulting cleavage products were separated by SDS-PAGE and detected by immunostaining with an anti-Flag antibody (M2) for C100-Flag or AICD-Flag (A), and by sandwich ELISA for AŒ≤1‚Äì40 or AŒ≤1‚Äì42 (B). Note that the levels of AŒ≤ produced from FAD-linked Œ≥-secretase complexes were all in the non-linear range of the ELISA standards, close to the detection limit. Whenever possible, AŒ≤1‚Äì42/AŒ≤1‚Äì40 ratios were quantified and indicated on the top of the bars. Two independent purifications were performed on each clone and similar results were obtained. A representative dataset is shown.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0035133.g005 Discussion Top Several conflicting results as to how Alzheimer's disease-linked mutations in PSEN1 affect the processing of APP by Œ≥-secretase have been reported. First, it has been previously reported that transgenic animals with FAD-linked PS1 mutations show increasing brain levels of AŒ≤1‚Äì42 [15], [38]. Since AŒ≤1‚Äì42, the first AŒ≤ specie deposited in the brain of AD patients [16], [39], is more prone to aggregation when compared to shorter AŒ≤ species [40], [41], [42], it has been implicated in the seeding of amyloid plaques in AD patients with PSEN1 mutations [43]. This was further validated in vivo as the overexpression of PS1 mutants in APP transgenic mice accelerated the rate of AŒ≤ accumulation and deposition in the brain [44], [45]. However, Bentahir and colleagues challenged this view by showing that several PSEN1 mutations were also capable to decrease total AŒ≤ production in PS1/PS2 knockout cells [23]. These findings suggested that endogenous PS1 and PS2 may influence the mutant phenotype in cells or in vivo. By extension, we hypothesized that the other components of Œ≥-secretase, namely APH1, NCT and PEN2, may influence the mutant phenotype as well. Indeed, Œ≥-secretase complexes are heterogeneous in composition due to the existence of two human APH1 genes, APH1a and APH1b, and two splicing isoforms of APH1a (S and L), as well as two presenilin genes, PSEN1 and PSEN2. Therefore, it is plausible that a single mutation in PSEN1 confers different catalytic properties to distinct Œ≥-secretase subtypes. This hypothesis is supported by recent investigations showing that APH1 variants can modulate AŒ≤ profiles. When compared to APH1aS or L, overexpression of APH1b in MEF knockout for all APH1 genes led to increased production of longer AŒ≤ species [24]. With this regard, it is important to note that all four mouse variants of APH1 are expressed in the MEF cell line used in previous studies [23] and employed here (cf. Figure S3). Since the phenotype of PS1 mutations have mainly been assessed in vivo or in cell-based systems, we investigated the effects of FAD-linked PS1 mutants on the processing of APP-CTFs in cell-free systems, by using semi-purified and purified enzymatic complexes isolated from MEF PS1/PS2 double knockout cells stably overexpressing differentially tagged human Œ≥-secretase components. Under these conditions, the biochemical and functional properties of Œ≥-secretase complexes bearing either FAD-linked PS1 mutants (L166P, ŒîE9, and P436Q), dominant-negative forms of PS1 or wild-type PS1 were characterized. The activity of Œ≥-secretase with PS1-WT was similar to that reported for Œ≥-secretase purified from our CHO cells overexpressing NCT-V5, APH1aL, Flag-PEN2 and PS1-WT [26], [27], that resulted in AŒ≤1‚Äì42/AŒ≤1‚Äì40 ratios between 0.1 and 0.3. In contrast, we found a major loss in the activity of Œ≥-secretase complexes containing either the dominant-negative PS1 variants or the FAD-linked PS1 mutants. Although a total loss of activity was expected for the dominant negative forms of Œ≥-secretase [5], [6], [32], the drastic loss of activity seen here with the FAD-linked PS1 mutants was unexpected. Indeed, the PS1-L166P variant has previously been reported to increase AŒ≤1‚Äì42 levels both in vivo [46] and in vitro [20], in the presence of endogenous PS1, PS2 and APH1 components. In contrast, Bentahir and colleagues found that PS1-L166P decreased both AŒ≤1‚Äì40 and AŒ≤1‚Äì42 production in a PS knockout background. These results are consistent with our in vitro data, although the reduction in AŒ≤1‚Äì42 and AŒ≤1‚Äì40 production was more pronounced in our system. However, they differ from our cell-based data in which we observed an increase in AŒ≤1‚Äì42 associated with a decrease in AŒ≤1‚Äì40. Taken together, these data suggest that the overexpression of the other human components of Œ≥-secretase can influence the phenotype of FAD-linked mutations. Another possible explanation for these discrepancies comes from the use, in previously described cellular systems, of APP carrying the Swedish mutation (K670M/N671L) [20], [23], [46]. Initially, this APP variant was shown to enhance the production of all AŒ≤ species by favouring its Œ≤-secretase cleavage [47], [48]. However, Munter and colleagues recently demonstrated that the APP Swedish mutation can also affect the specificity of the Œ≥-secretase cleavage [49]. In particular, these authors showed that over-expression of APP Swedish in a neuronal cell line led to a 4-fold increase in secreted AŒ≤42, associated with only a 2-fold increase of total AŒ≤, compared with the wild-type APP. Therefore, one cannot exclude the possibility of differential interactions between PS1-WT or PS1 variants and different APP variants, as suggested earlier [50].As far as the PS1-ŒîE9 mutant is concerned, previous cell-based studies have reported a decrease in AŒ≤40 levels associated with an increase in AŒ≤42 levels [51], [52], or no changes in AŒ≤40 levels despite increased AŒ≤42 levels [53], or a decrease in both AŒ≤ species [23]. In the present study, AŒ≤1‚Äì40, AŒ≤1‚Äì42, as well as AICD levels generated from purified Œ≥-secretase complexes with PS1-ŒîE9 were close to the limit of detection, resulting in a loss of at least 95% of the Œ≥-secretase activity compared to wild-type PS1. Similarly, we found a near to complete loss of Œ≥-secretase activity for complexes with the aggressive PS1-P436Q mutant (mean onset: 28.3 years) [54]. Consistent with a recent study [35], and in contrast to PS1-L166P, the maturation of the full-length PS1-P436Q protein into PS1-NTF and PS1-CTF was impaired. Interestingly, the same study also reported that P436Q variant showed a decreased Œ≥-secretase activity and AŒ≤40 and AŒ≤42 secretion in PS1/PS2 double knockout cells (~75% or ~50% of the control for AŒ≤40 or AŒ≤42, respectively), but to a lesser extent than what we measured in this study (more than 97% for both AŒ≤ species).Overall, our data show that, under our experimental conditions, the FAD-linked PS1 mutants cause a drastic loss of activity (at least 90%) in the highly purified and homogeneous as well as semi-purified Œ≥-secretase complexes. This loss-of-function is asymmetrical as AŒ≤1‚Äì42 levels were relatively less affected than AŒ≤1‚Äì40 levels. Interestingly, the ratio between the two AŒ≤ species was similar for the variants tested here (~1), suggesting a common modulatory mechanism. Our findings further support a model in which the subtype of Œ≥-secretase containing APH1aL and FAD-linked PS1 mutants generates a higher AŒ≤42/AŒ≤40 ratio compared to PS1-WT, as previously observed in vivo [15], [38]. Taken together, the overall reduction in AŒ≤ levels strongly suggest that other regulatory mechanisms or cellular components may exist and account for the strong amyloid pathology observed in AD patients carrying these FAD-linked PSEN1 mutations. In agreement with this hypothesis, we report that the phenotype of FAD-linked PSEN1 mutations is different whether we consider the cell-based or the cell-free conditions. Indeed, even if AŒ≤42/AŒ≤40 ratios were globally increased in both experimental conditions, AŒ≤ production was strikingly different.One possible explanation would be that specific subtypes of Œ≥-secretase complexes are less affected than others by PSEN1 mutations. For instance, it remains unknown whether Œ≥-secretase complexes carrying APH1b or APH1aS are similarly affected by PSEN1 mutations. In support to that regard, Winkler and colleagues recently purified human Œ≥-secretase with PS1-L166P and observed that such complexes, containing both APH1a and AHP1b, led to increased AŒ≤1‚Äì42 production associated with decreased AŒ≤1‚Äì40 production, as compared to the PS1-WT complexes. Another possible explanation would be that purified Œ≥-secretase complexes lack binding partners modulating the processing of APP-based substrates, due to purification conditions affecting physical interactions of proteins. These include TMP21 or the recently reported Œ≥-secretase activating protein (GSAP) [12], [13]. Further biochemical analyses are needed to test this hypothesis.The loss of activity in Œ≥-secretase containing PS1 variants also leads to decreased generation of AICD. As AICD is involved in the transcriptional regulation of several genes, including the neprilysin [55], and the lipoprotein receptor, LRP1 [11], it is likely that mutations in PSEN1 impair the regulation of these genes in vivo. For instance, it is possible that unknown genes transcriptionally regulated in vivo by the AICD might influence AŒ≤ metabolism in return. In support to these views, Veeraraghavalu and colleagues recently demonstrated that Notch signalling was impaired in transgenic mice overexpressing PS1 mutants, albeit in the presence of endogenous PS1-WT and all APH1 isoforms [56]. They found decreased self-renewal and differentiation of neuronal precursor cells in the subventricular zone, suggesting that the loss-of-function phenotype of PSEN1 mutations can also be observed in heterogeneous conditions. These results are reminiscent of the previous report from Saura and colleagues showing that conditional inactivation of both presenilins in vivo induces age-dependent neurodegeneration associated with memory impairment [57]. Altogether, the above-described data suggest that alternative pathways of neurodegeneration related to loss of Œ≥-secretase functions are possible and relevant to AD. They further support the concept that modulating rather than inhibiting Œ≥-secretase activity would be a more appropriate therapeutic strategy for AD [58]. Supporting this view, the Œ≥-secretase inhibitor Semagacestat tested in phase III clinical trials not only failed to slow cognitive decline in patients with mild-to-moderate AD, but actually made it worse [59].Collectively, our findings support a model in which FAD-linked mutations in PSEN1 likely induce AŒ≤ pathology by perturbing the relative ratio between AŒ≤ species and by impairing developmental and cellular signalling pathways controlled by Œ≥-secretase substrates. This deleterious dual effect might explain why FAD-linked PSEN1 mutations cause early onset Alzheimer's disease. Since it has been established that AŒ≤ and AICD are generated following the processing by Œ≥-secretase at two distinct gamma- and epsilon-cleavage sites in APP [60], further investigation is now required to better understand whether and how FAD mutations in PS1 differentially affect the epsilon versus gamma-cleavage sites in APP, as well as in other known Œ≥-secretase substrates.Materials and Methods Top DNA Constructs and mutagenesisNCT-V5, Flag-PEN2, APH1aL-HA, wild-type PS1 human cDNAs (PS1-WT) were obtained from D. Selkoe (Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA). PS1 ŒîE9 cDNA was obtained from C. Saura (Universitat Aut√≤noma de Barcelona, Spain). PS1 D257A and PS1 D385A cDNAs were obtained from M. Wolfe (Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA). Mutations in PSEN1, namely, L166P and P436Q, were generated by PCR-based mutagenesis on the plasmid pcDNA3.1/Zeo(+)-PS1-WT using T7 or BGH primers (specific to the plasmid DNA sequence) together with the corresponding primers: L166P Rv: 5‚Ä≤ CAG CAA CAA Taa gct tGA TAT AAT AGG 3‚Ä≤; L166P Fw: 5‚Ä≤ CTT ATT ATA TCa agc ttA TTG TTG CTG 3‚Ä≤; P436Q Rv: 5‚Ä≤ TCG AGT TTA Gaa gct tTC TTG AAA ATG GCA AGG AG 3‚Ä≤; P436Q Fw: 5‚Ä≤ TCG AGT TTA Gaa gct tTG CCA GCT CTT CAA ATC TCC 3‚Ä≤. The sequences corresponding to enzyme restriction sites are given in small letters. The PCR fragments were next digested with BamHI/HindIII and HindIII/XhoI respectively, and were subcloned into pcDNA3. PS1 D257A/D385A (DDAA) was obtained by subcloning the DraI/XhoI digested fragment of PS1 D385A into pcDNA3.1-PS1 D257A. The APP based substrate SPA4CT-Flag, corresponding to the signal peptide of APP fused to the APP-C99-Flag with a small linker region (DA) [36], was obtained by removing the HindIII/EcoRI fragment of pcDNA3-APP695-Flag and inserting the following annealed primers: 5‚Ä≤ AGC TTA TGC TGC CCG GTT TG GCA CTG CTC CTG CTG GCC GCC TGG ACG GCT CGG GCG GAT GCA GAT GCA G 3‚Ä≤ and 5‚Ä≤ AAT TCT GCA TCT GCA TCC GCC CGA GCC GTC CAG GCG GCC AGC AGG AGC AGT GCC AAA CCG GGC AGC ATA 3‚Ä≤. All constructs were next subcloned into the self-inactivated vector pSIN-PGK-WHV cassette (a kind gift from R. Zufferey, Brain Mind Institute, EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland). Inserts for plasmids pET21-C100-Flag, and pET21-C100-His were generated by PCR as previously described [27]. Plasmids pMD2G and psPAX2 were obtained from D. Trono (Global Health Institute, EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland).Lentivector productionReplication-defective lentiviral particles were produced by a three-plasmid transient transfection of cells from the human embryonic kidney HEK 293T cell line [61]. Briefly, cells were incubated in 10 cm dishes until they reached 70% confluence and were transiently co-transfected by the calcium phosphate method, with 5 ¬µg of envelope plasmid (pMD2G), 15 ¬µg of packaging plasmid (psPAX2), and 20 ¬µg of vector plasmids (pSIN-PGK-WHV). Cells were incubated overnight with DNA-calcium precipitates, washed twice with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Invitrogen) and incubated with 7 mL of DMEM. After 24 h, the conditioned medium was harvested and cells were incubated a second time with 7 mL of DMEM for 24 h. Media were then pooled, passed through 0.45 ¬µm filter, and stored at ‚àí80¬∞C as 2 mL aliquots until use. A p24 ELISA (Zeptometrix corporation) was performed on each batch of media in order to evaluate the number of viral particles generated.Generation of stable cell lines through multiple gene transductionsMouse Embryonic Fibroblasts (MEFs, obtained from B. De Strooper, Flanders University Institute of Biotechnology, Belgium) defective in PSEN1 and PSEN2 [30], [31] were cultivated in 10 cm dishes in DMEM, supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS) and penicillin/streptomycin (P/S) (Invitrogen). A first set of stable cell lines was generated by co-transducing NCT-V5, APH1aL-HA, and Flag-PEN2 containing lentiviral vectors (LV) repeatedly for two weeks at each passage (1/20). Ten clones were isolated by the limiting dilution method and were further screened for NCT-V5, Flag-PEN2 and APH1aL-HA expression by immunodetection. The clone that showed the highest expression of the three proteins (designated Œ≥ - PS1/2) was used as the parental cell line to generate the stable cell lines expressing different PS1 variants, by the same method and by using lentiviral vectors carrying human PS1-WT, PS1-L166P, PS1-ŒîE9, PS1-P436Q, PS1-D257A, PS1-D385A, and PS1-DDAA. For each PS1 variant, five clones were selected for a full characterization and two of them were further used for Œ≥-secretase purification. For SPA4CT overexpression experiments, 500,000 cells of each clone were exposed to the same arbitrary dose of lentiviral vectors carrying human SPA4CT-Flag in 2 mL of DMEM, 1% FBS, P/S and were plated in 6-wells plates for 72 h. The medium was next replaced by fresh DMEM, 2% FBS, P/S for 24 h. Finally, cell culture medium was harvested, supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche), centrifuged for 3 min at 1,000√ó rpm and frozen at ‚àí80¬∞C until further processing. Cells were washed in PBS and submitted to protein extraction.Protein extractionTotal protein extracts were prepared in 1% NP40 - HEPES buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM CaCl2), supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche), and were clarified by centrifugation for 1 h at 16,000√ó g, 4¬∞C. Cell membranes were obtained as described below and solubilised in 1% CHAPSO - HEPES buffer and centrifuged at 16,000√ó g for 1 h. Supernatants corresponding to the microsomal protein extracts were harvested and stored at ‚àí80¬∞C. Protein content of the extracts was estimated by the BCA protein assay reagent kit (Pierce).Multi-step purification of human Œ≥-secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 variants1) Cell membrane preparation. MEF PS1/PS2 DKO cells (1.0√ó109 cells) expressing NCT-V5, Flag-PEN2, APH1aL-HA and different forms of PS1: wild type (WT), or with FAD-linked variants or lacking the critical aspartate residues, were collected from 15 cm dishes and fully resuspended in 40 mL of MES buffer (50 mM MES, pH 6.0, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM CaCl2), supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). Next, cells were passed four times through a high-pressure homogenizer (Emulsiflex-C5, Avestin Inc, ON Canada) at a pressure greater than 1,000 psi. Nuclei and unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation at 3,000√ó g for 20 min at 4¬∞C in a Beckman Coulter Allegra X-15R centrifuge. The supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 100,000√ó g for 1 h at 4¬∞C in a SW32Ti rotor using a Beckman Coulter Optima L-80 ultracentrifuge to recover the membrane preparation in the pellet. 2) Bicarbonate wash. The membrane pellet was fully resuspended in 1.6 mL of ice cold sodium bicarbonate buffer (0.1 M NaHCO3, pH 11.3) by pipetting up and down at least 30 times, and incubated at 4¬∞C for 20 min. The washed membranes were then centrifuged at 100,000√ó g for 1 h at 4¬∞C and stored at ‚àí80¬∞C until use. 3) Solubilisation of Œ≥-secretase complexes. The bicarbonate-washed membranes were fully resuspended in 1.7 mL of 1% CHAPSO - HEPES buffer by pipetting up and down at least 30 times. The membranes were then incubated at 4¬∞C for 1 h. To pellet the insoluble material, the solution was centrifuged at 16,000√ó g at 4¬∞C for 1 h, the pellet was discarded, and the supernatant saved. This lysate is defined as ‚Äúsolubilised Œ≥-secretase preparation‚Äù. Next, these freshly prepared solubilised preparations were used for affinity purification of Œ≥-secretase complexes as described below. 4) Anti-Flag M2 affinity purification. The solubilised Œ≥-secretase preparations were first diluted 1:2 with HEPES buffer, and further diluted 1:6 with 0.1% digitonin - TBS buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl) (final detergent concentration: 0.08% CHAPSO, 0.08% digitonin) and incubated overnight at 4¬∞C with agitation after adding 200 ¬µL of anti-Flag M2 affinity resin beads (Sigma-Aldrich) that had been pre-equilibrated in 0.1% Digitonin - TBS buffer. The beads were washed 3 times in the same buffer, and the bound proteins were eluted over 4 h at 4¬∞C with 0.4 mL of this buffer containing 200 ¬µg/mL of Flag peptides (Sigma-Aldrich). This elution step was repeated once for 1 h at 4¬∞C and the eluted fractions were pooled and designated ‚ÄúM2 pooled 800 ¬µL fractions‚Äù. 5) Anti-V5 affinity purification. The M2 pooled fractions (volume made up to 1 mL with 0.1% Digitonin - TBS buffer) were next incubated overnight at 4¬∞C under agitation with 200 ¬µL of anti-V5 affinity resin beads (Sigma-Aldrich), pre-equilibrated in 0.1% digitonin-TBS buffer. The beads were washed 3 times in the same buffer, and the bound proteins were eluted for 1 h at 4¬∞C with 0.4 mL of this buffer containing 500 ¬µg/mL of V5 peptides (Sigma-Aldrich). This elution step was repeated 4 times, and the eluted fractions were pooled and designated ‚ÄúV5 pooled 1.6 mL fractions‚Äù. 6) Anti-HA affinity purification. As a final purification step, the V5 pooled fractions (volume made up to 1.8 mL with 0.1% digitonin - TBS buffer) were next incubated overnight at 4¬∞C under agitation with 200 ¬µL of anti-HA affinity resin beads (Sigma-Aldrich), pre-equilibrated in 0.1% digitonin - TBS buffer. The beads were washed 3 times in the same buffer, and the bound proteins were eluted overnight at 4¬∞C with 0.2 mL of this buffer containing 200 ¬µg/mL of HA peptides (Sigma-Aldrich). This elution step was repeated once, for 1 h at 4¬∞C, and the two eluted fractions were kept separately, designated ‚ÄúHA fraction E1‚Äù and ‚ÄúHA fraction E2‚Äù.Co-immunoprecipitationCo-IPs were performed on microsomal protein extracts. Briefly, 100 ¬µg of proteins were diluted in a final volume of 1 mL of 1% CHAPSO - HEPES extraction buffer containing protease inhibitors (Roche), and 50 ¬µL of pre-equilibrated anti-Flag or anti-HA affinity beads (Sigma-Aldrich) were added. Samples were next incubated overnight at 4¬∞C on a rotator wheel and were washed three times in 0.2% CHAPSO - HEPES buffer. Finally, beads were resuspended in 50 ¬µL of 0.2% CHAPSO - HEPES buffer and were used for in vitro Œ≥-secretase assays.In vitro Œ≥-secretase activity assaysIn vitro Œ≥-secretase activity assays were performed as previously described [27]. Œ≥-Secretase APP-based substrates were expressed in E. coli transfected with plasmids pET21-C100-Flag or pET21-C100-His as a fusion protein consisting of a Met for translation initiation, and either the Flag tag sequence (C100-Flag) or the His tag sequence (C100-His), and were affinity purified using an anti-Flag resin (M2, Sigma-Aldrich) or an Ni-NTA agarose resin (Invitrogen), respectively. In vitro assays were performed at 37¬∞C for 4 h, with 1 ¬µM of recombinant substrate, 0.025% phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and 0.1% phosphatidylcholine (PC). Œ≥-Secretase activity was quantified by measuring the amount of AICD and AŒ≤ generated during the reaction, by immunoblot or sandwich ELISA respectively, as described below.SDS-PAGE, Native PAGE, Western blotting and antibodiesTotal or microsomal protein extracts were resolved by electrophoresis on NuPAGE¬Æ Novex¬Æ 4‚Äì12% Bis-Tris Gels (Invitrogen) or on standard 12% acrylamide/bisacrylamide Tris Glycine gels for SDS-PAGE analysis. Purified Œ≥-secretase was resolved by electrophoresis on NativePAGE‚Ñ¢ Novex¬Æ Bis-Tris 4‚Äì16% Gels for Blue Native (BN)-PAGE analysis (Invitrogen). Silver staining was performed directly on gel according to manufacturer instructions (Biorad). For immunoblot analysis, gels were transferred to nitrocellulose or PVDF membranes (Whatman), and probed with the following antibodies: anti-Nicastrin NCT164 (BD Bioscience), anti-V5-tag for NCT-V5 (Covance), MAB1563 (Millipore) or ab10281 (Abcam) for PS1 NTF, MAB5232 for PS1 CTF (Millipore), 3F10 for APH1aL-HA (Roche), anti-Flag M2 for Flag-PEN-2 or C100-Flag (Sigma-Aldrich), A8717 for APP CTF (Sigma-Aldrich), and A2066 for Œ≤-actin (Sigma-Aldrich). Anti-mouse/rabbit/rat IgG conjugated to Alexa 680 were purchased from Invitrogen. The Odyssey infrared imaging system (LICOR) was used to detect the fluorescent signal.Quantification of AŒ≤ peptidesAŒ≤ peptides from the Œ≥-secretase assays described above were quantified by sandwich ELISA according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. Three kits were used to detect human AŒ≤1‚Äì40(Invitrogen KHB3481) and AŒ≤1‚Äì42 (Invitrogen KHB3544 and Wako 269-64401).Supporting Information Top Figure S1. Characterization of stable cell lines overexpressing human FAD-linked PS1 variants in MEF PS1/2‚àí/‚àí. Presenilin double-knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts were stably transduced with lentiviral vectors carrying genes encoding hPS1 variants harbouring FAD-linked mutations or mutations in the catalytic aspartate residue(s), or PS1-WT, and cloned. Two clones per PS1 variant were selected for characterization. (A) Whole cell protein extracts of the different cell lines were prepared in 1% NP40-HEPES buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE on 12% Tris-Glycine gels and analysed by immunostaining with various antibodies to detect the endogenous Œ≥-secretase core components: NCT (NCT164), hPS1 (NTF, MAB1563), and PEN2 (UD1), and with an antibody for APP (A8717). Œ≤-Actin was used as a loading control. Each lane represents one selected clone. (B) Œ≥-Secretase activity assays were performed with microsomal extracts prepared in 1% CHAPSO-HEPES buffer. Equal protein levels from the different extracts were diluted to 0.25% CHAPSO-HEPES buffer and incubated for 4 h at 37¬∞C with lipids and 1 ¬µM of recombinant human APP-based substrate (C100-Flag). Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunostained with anti-Flag (M2) or anti-PS1 (MAB1563).

APH1 isoforms expressed in MEF PS1/2‚àí/‚àí. Total RNAs were extracted from presenilin double-knockout MEFs, using standard procedures (Qiagen RNAeasy kit) and were quantified by spectrophotometry. One microgram of total RNAs was reverse transcribed for 1 h at 42¬∞C by using the ImProm-II reverse transcription system (Promega) and oligo-dT primer in a final volume of 20 ¬µL. PCR was next performed for each APH1 isoform on 1 ¬µL of RT reaction by using the Roche PCR kit under standard conditions and the primers described in Table S1. The following cycling conditions were applied for all reactions: 94¬∞C, 3 min; 30 cycles of [94¬∞C, 30 s; 58¬∞C, 30 s; 70¬∞C, 40 s]; 70¬∞C, 10 min.

Fraering*√âcole Polytechnique F√©d√©rale de Lausanne, Brain Mind Institute, Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Biology of Alzheimer's Disease, Lausanne, SwitzerlandAbstract Top BackgroundMutations linked to early onset, familial forms of Alzheimer's disease (FAD) are found most frequently in PSEN1, the gene encoding presenilin-1 (PS1). Together with nicastrin (NCT), anterior pharynx-defective protein 1 (APH1), and presenilin enhancer 2 (PEN2), the catalytic subunit PS1 constitutes the core of the Œ≥-secretase complex and contributes to the proteolysis of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) into amyloid-beta (AŒ≤) peptides. Although there is a growing consensus that FAD-linked PS1 mutations affect AŒ≤ production by enhancing the AŒ≤1‚Äì42/AŒ≤1‚Äì40 ratio, it remains unclear whether and how they affect the generation of APP intracellular domain (AICD). Moreover, controversy exists as to how PS1 mutations exert their effects in different experimental systems, by either increasing AŒ≤1‚Äì42 production, decreasing AŒ≤1‚Äì40 production, or both. Because it could be explained by the heterogeneity in the composition of Œ≥-secretase, we purified to homogeneity complexes made of human NCT, APH1aL, PEN2, and the pathogenic PS1 mutants L166P, ŒîE9, or P436Q.Methodology/Principal FindingsWe took advantage of a mouse embryonic fibroblast cell line lacking PS1 and PS2 to generate different stable cell lines overexpressing human Œ≥-secretase complexes with different FAD-linked PS1 mutations. A multi-step affinity purification procedure was used to isolate semi-purified or highly purified Œ≥-secretase complexes. The functional characterization of these complexes revealed that all PS1 FAD-linked mutations caused a loss of Œ≥-secretase activity phenotype, in terms of AŒ≤1‚Äì40, AŒ≤1‚Äì42 and APP intracellular domain productions in vitro.Conclusion/SignificanceOur data support the view that PS1 mutations lead to a strong Œ≥-secretase loss-of-function phenotype and an increased AŒ≤1‚Äì42/AŒ≤1‚Äì40 ratio, two mechanisms that are potentially involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.Citation: Cacquevel M, Aeschbach L, Houacine J, Fraering PC (2012) Alzheimer's Disease-Linked Mutations in Presenilin-1 Result in a Drastic Loss of Activity in Purified Œ≥-Secretase Complexes.

PSEN1 and PSEN2 encode transmembrane proteins PS1 and PS2, respectively, that constitute the catalytic core of Œ≥-secretase, the founding member of an emerging class of unconventional, Intramembrane-Cleaving Proteases (I-CLiPs) [3]. Active Œ≥-secretase is a multiprotein complex composed of PS1 or PS2 together with nicastrin (NCT), the anterior pharynx-defective protein 1 (APH1), and the presenilin enhancer 2 (PEN2). Experimental evidence such as the binding of transition-state analogue Œ≥-secretase inhibitors to PS1 [4], as well as the abolishment of Œ≥-secretase activity when PS1 lacks the aspartate residues critical for proteolysis [4], [5], [6], have confirmed that presenilins harbour the active site of the enzymatic complex.PS1 and PS2 play fundamental roles in cell signalling as part of the Œ≥-secretase complex. The latter cleaves numerous type-I membrane proteins in their transmembrane domain [7], releasing their corresponding intracellular domains, which are capable of influencing gene expression. For some substrates like NOTCH1 or ERBB4, the Œ≥-secretase cleavage is essential for their biological function, whereas for other substrates like DCC or NEUREXIN-3Œ≤ [8], the possible role of the cleavage in signalling events has not been formally established (see [9] for a review). The amyloid precursor protein (APP) is processed by the successive actions of Œ≤-secretase (BACE1) and Œ≥-secretase, generating amyloid-beta peptides (AŒ≤) of different lengths, ranging from 37 to 46 amino acids [10]. Cleavage of the APP C-terminal fragments (APP-CTFs) by Œ≥-secretase also releases the APP intracellular domain (AICD), which has been recently involved in the regulation of brain ApoE expression, a major genetic determinant of AD, and in cholesterol metabolism [11]. In addition, PS1 has been shown to interact with a growing list of proteins that modulate Œ≥-secretase activity [9], [12], [13], [14].In a pathological context, 185 missense mutations in PSEN1 and 13 mutations in PSEN2 have been identified and found to be associated with FAD (www.molgen.ua.ac.be/ADMutations). It was initially suggested that such mutations lead to a toxic gain of function because they are associated with a relative increased production of longer and more hydrophobic AŒ≤ species, mainly AŒ≤1‚Äì42, that accumulate and aggregate early in the course of thedisease [15], [16]. Similar phenotypes have been observed by independent groups in cell-based studies performed with different mammalian cell lines [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22]. Despite this growing consensus, the above-mentioned studies provided conflicting results regarding the relative proportions of AŒ≤42, AŒ≤40, and AICD resulting from the PSEN mutations. On one hand, a gain-of-function phenotype was suggested due to the observed increase in AŒ≤42 production, accompanied or not with reduced AŒ≤40 production, thereby leading to an increased AŒ≤42/AŒ≤40 ratio. On the other hand, reduced AICD production suggested a loss-of-function phenotype [20]. Differences in the methodologies and cell types used to assess the effects of PSEN mutations on AŒ≤ and AICD productions can explain this controversy as to how PS mutations exert their effects. For example, endogenous PS has been suggested to affect such analysis, as the FAD-linked PSEN1 mutations led to a decrease in the total amount of AŒ≤ generated in PS1 and PS2 double knockout cells [23]. Next, it has been reported that Œ≥-secretase complexes are heterogeneous in composition (with two PS genes and three APH1 isoforms, six combinations of Œ≥-secretase are possible), with distinct functional properties influencing the relative amount of AŒ≤ species generated [24]. In order to investigate the biochemical and functional properties of Œ≥-secretase in cell-free systems, we and others have recently purified this enzymatic complex to homogeneity [25], [26], [27]. In particular, protocols for the high-grade purification of proteolytically active Œ≥-secretase constituted of NCT, APH1aL, PEN2 and wild-type PS1 [26], [27] allowed the reconstitution of 3D structures at 15 √Ö and 12 √Ö resolution by EM and cryo-EM and gave new insights on the structure and activity of the enzyme [28], [29]. However, these studies were exclusively focused on the wild-type PS1. Here, we report for the first time the functional characterization of highly purified and homogenous human Œ≥-secretase particles carrying different FAD-linked PS1 mutants. Our biochemical and functional findings strongly suggest that pathogenic mutations in PSEN1 cause a loss of Œ≥-secretase activity.Results Top Generation, selection and characterization of stable cell lines overexpressing Œ≥-secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 mutantsIn order to facilitate high-grade purification of homogenous human Œ≥-secretase complexes containing different PS1 variants, we took advantage of a previously generated mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cell line that lacks the two presenilins (PS1/2‚àí/‚àí) [30], [31]. Our global strategy consisted in producing stable cell lines, on a PS1/2‚àí/‚àí background, that overexpress tagged versions of the three human Œ≥-secretase subunits NCT, APH1 and PEN2 together with different variants of human PS1, and to purify the different human Œ≥-secretase complexes by three sequential affinity purification steps. This strategy allowed us to exclude a possible co-purification of mouse Œ≥-secretase components. First, a parental cell line was generated by co-transducing lentiviral vectors of human NCT-V5 (hNCT-V5), human APH1aL-HA (hAPH1aL-HA) and human Flag-PEN2 (Flag-hPEN2) into MEF PS1/2‚àí/‚àí. Lentivectors are stably integrated into the cell genome and allow the generation of cell lines overexpressing multiple genes in a short period of time. Next, the clone expressing the highest levels of all three recombinant proteins was selected (designated Œ≥ - PS1/2) and used as the parental cell line that was further transduced with lentivectors carrying the following different human PS1 variants: PS1-WT, three dominant-negative forms of PS1 that lack the crucial, catalytic site aspartate residues (D257A, D385A, and both D257A/D385A referred to as DDAA later in the article), and three FAD-linked PS1 mutants (L166P, ŒîE9 and P436Q, with mean disease onset at 24 years, 45.5 years and 28.3 years, respectively).For each PS1 variant, two individual clones were selected based on the expression levels of the recombinant proteins, and extensively characterized (Figure 1). To distinguish those cell lines overexpressing all Œ≥-sectease components from wild-type MEFs, they are collectively designated Œ≥-MEFs. As shown in Figure 1A, the analysis of total protein extracts confirmed that PS is required for the maturation of NCT and the stability of PEN2 [23], [32]. As expected, and when compared to the parental Œ≥- PS1/2 cell line, higher levels of the mature form of NCT were observed in all PS1-overexpressing clones. In contrast to PEN2, APH1aL levels were relatively similar in all PS1 clones and the parental cell line. Indeed, and as previously reported [23], [32], PEN2 levels were higher in the clones overexpressing WT PS1 and FAD-linked PS1 mutants, and to a lesser extent in the clones overexpressing the dominant negative forms of PS1. Interestingly, PEN2 migrated on the gel as an apparent double band, possibly reflecting a post-translational modification. Different patterns of PS1 expression and autoproteolysis were observed in the different clones. First, and in sharp contrast to the other clones, those expressing PS1-WT or PS1-L166P displayed higher levels of PS1-NTF and PS1-CTF fragments compared with full-length PS1 (PS1-FL; Figure 1A). As estimated by densitometry, the NTF fragments of PS1-WT and PS1-L166P account for 87¬±2% and 79¬±7% of total PS1 (PS1-NTF+PS1-FL), respectively. Next, the PS1-ŒîE9 clones did not show any detectable NTF or CTF fragments, as previously described [33], while P436Q and the three dominant negative variants of PS1 were characterized by low levels of PS1-NTF and PS1-CTF fragments, suggesting that these variants were less prone to endoproteolysis.thumbnailFigure 1. Generation of stable cell lines overexpressing all human Œ≥-secretase components with FAD-linked PS1 variants.MEF PS1/2‚àí/‚àí were stably co-transduced with lentiviral vectors carrying genes encoding hNCT-V5, Flag-hPEN2, hAPH1aL-HA and clones were isolated by limiting dilution to generate a cell line, designated as Œ≥- PS1/2, that overexpresses high amount of the three subunits. Œ≥- PS1/2 MEFs were further transduced with hPS1 variants harbouring FAD-linked mutations or mutations in the catalytic aspartate residue(s), or PS1-WT, and cloned. Each clone, derived form the Œ≥- PS1/2, was conveniently named according to the mutation present in PS1 preceded by the symbol Œ≥ and followed by the number of the clone (Œ≥-MEF) in order to distinguish them from wild-type MEF (WT MEF) and MEF PS1/2‚àí/‚àí. Two clones per Œ≥-secretase variant were selected for characterization. (A‚ÄìB) Whole cell protein extracts of the different cell lines were prepared in 1% NP40-HEPES buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE on 4‚Äì12% Bis-Tris or 12% Tris-Glycine gels and analysed by immunostaining to detect the Œ≥-secretase core components NCT (NCT164), PS1 (NTF, MAB1563; CTF; MAB5232), APH1aL-HA (3F10), and Flag-PEN2 (M2) (A), and endogenous APP (A8717) (B). Œ≤-Actin was used as a loading control. Each lane represents one selected clone. CTF: C-terminal fragment, FL: full-length, im.: immature NCT; m.: mature NCT, N: N-glycosylated, NTF: N-terminal fragment, O: O-glycosylated.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0035133.g001 We next investigated the effects of PSEN1 mutations on the processing of endogenous APP. As expected, and as indicated by increased levels of intracellular APP-CTFs (a common characteristic among known substrates in response to Œ≥-secretase pharmacological inhibition), the activity of Œ≥-secretase was significantly altered in the PS deficient parental Œ≥ - PS1/2 cell line as well as in all clones expressing dominant negative forms of PS1 (Figure 1B). In the clones expressing PS1-WT, APP-CTFs were almost undetectable due to high Œ≥-secretase activity, while clones expressing PS1-L166P or PS1-P436Q displayed APP-CTF accumulation. In PS1-ŒîE9 clones, a mild APP-CTF accumulation was observed (Figure 1B). Although a poor recovery of Œ≥-secretase activity for the PS1-L166P and a comparatively better performance of PS1-ŒîE9 have been reported by others under similar experimental conditions [23], the potential of PS1-P436Q mutation to restore the processing of endogenous APP-CTFs has never been assessed [34], [35]. Importantly, all observations described above for the cells overexpressing simultaneously hNCT-V5, hAPH1aL-HA, Flag-hPEN2 and the different PS1 variants are very consistent with those made in MEF PS1/2‚àí/‚àí cells overexpressing only the PS1 variants, in the absence of the other Œ≥-secretase components (cf. Figure S1A). These data suggest that the effect of FAD mutations in PS1 on APP-CTFs accumulation was similar in presence or absence of other human components of the Œ≥-secretase.Next, we further investigated the effect of PS1 variants on the cellular production/secretion of AŒ≤ species. For this purpose, and as described elsewhere [36], we used an APP-based Œ≥-secretase substrate with a Flag tag at its C-terminus (SPA4CT-Flag). This substrate was transduced in the above-described Œ≥-secretase overexpressing stable cell lines (Œ≥-MEFs) as well as in wild-type MEFs, and APP-CTFs and AŒ≤ levels were measured in cell lysate and cell media, respectively (Figure 2). Under these conditions, the overexpression of SPA4CT-Flag led to an accumulation of two bands corresponding to the exogenous substrate, associated with a concomitant decrease of endogenous APP-CTFs levels (Figure 2A and Figure S2). As estimated by ELISA, a three-fold increase in AŒ≤1‚Äì40 and AŒ≤1‚Äì42 levels was observed in the cell culture media of cell lines overexpressing human Œ≥-secretase (Œ≥-MEF WT), in comparison to untransduced WT MEFs (Figure 2B). Also, the average AŒ≤1‚Äì42/AŒ≤1‚Äì40 ratios were not significantly different in those cell lines (Mean ¬± SD: Œ≥-MEF WT#5: 0.30¬±0.01; Œ≥-MEF WT#8: 0.29¬±0.01; WT MEF: 0.19¬±0.06). Next, overexpression of SPA4CT-Flag in Œ≥-MEFs led to the pronounced intracellular accumulation of APP-CTFs in cells overexpressing the PS1 aspartate mutants (Figure 2C), and to the secretion in the cell culture media of different AŒ≤ levels as measured by ELISA (Figure 2D). First, only traces of both AŒ≤1‚Äì40 and AŒ≤1‚Äì42 were detected in Œ≥-MEFs overexpressing PS1 with aspartate mutants. Next, Œ≥-MEFs overexpressing PS1 with FAD-linked mutations displayed a pronounced variability in AŒ≤ levels when compared to the wild-type clones. Overall, the average AŒ≤1‚Äì40 levels were decreased in these cell lines (Mean of two clones in pg/mL ¬± SD: WT: 224.6¬±0.1, L166P: 84.3¬±34.2, ŒîE9: 167.2¬±40.7, P436Q: 82.8¬±74.7), while the AŒ≤1‚Äì42 levels were increased (Mean of two clones in pg/mL ¬± SD: WT: 69.9¬±7.9, L166P: 310.7¬±81.0, ŒîE9: 94.4¬±18.5, P436Q: 141.1¬±98.5). Consistent with previously reported data, the AŒ≤1‚Äì42/AŒ≤1‚Äì40 ratios were increased in all Œ≥-MEF clones overexpressing PS1 with FAD-linked mutations (Figure 2D) (Mean of two clones pg/mL ¬± SD: WT: 0.31¬±0.03, L166P: 3.8¬±0.58, ŒîE9: 0.6¬±0.03, P436Q: 2.0¬±0.59).thumbnailFigure 2. AŒ≤ production in cell lines overexpressing human Œ≥-secretase components with FAD-linked PS1 variants.WT MEF, Œ≥-MEF and Œ≥ - PS1/2 were transduced with an APP-based substrate corresponding to the 99 C-terminal residues of human APP fused to the APP signal peptide in N-terminus (SPA4CT [36]) and a Flag Tag in C-terminus. Cell proteins were extracted in 1% NP40-HEPES buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE on 12% Tris-Glycine gels and analysed by immunostaining with an antibody targeting the C-terminal part of APP (A8717) (A, C). AŒ≤1‚Äì40 and AŒ≤1‚Äì42 levels were also measured in the corresponding cell culture media (B, D). Data corresponds to three independent experiments (Mean ¬± SEM).doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0035133.g002 FAD-linked PS1 mutations alter the activity of semi-purified Œ≥-secretase complexesWe next assessed the activity of Œ≥-secretase with FAD-linked PS1 mutations in microsomal extracts of Œ≥-MEFs. Membrane protein extracts were prepared and Œ≥-secretase activity was assayed on an exogenous recombinant APP-based substrate consisting of the C-terminal 99 amino acid residues of APP, and referred to as C100-Flag (Figure 3A). The generation of the cleavage product AICD-Flag was detected by Western blot analysis and measured by densitometry. As shown in Figure 3A, the levels of AICD-Flag generated from the PS1-L166P and PS1-ŒîE9 clones accounted for 42¬±1% and 13¬±6% of that in the PS1-WT clones, respectively. AICD-Flag was undetectable in the clones expressing PS1-P436Q as well as in the three dominant negative aspartate PS1 variants. Similar results were observed in MEF PS1/2‚àí/‚àí cells overexpressing only the PS1 variants, in the absence of the other human Œ≥-secretase components (Figure S1B).thumbnailFigure 3. Enzymatic activity of partially purified Œ≥-secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 mutants.(A) Œ≥-Secretase activity assays performed with Œ≥-MEF and Œ≥ - PS1/2 microsomal extracts prepared in 1% CHAPSO-HEPES buffer. Equal protein levels from the different extracts were diluted to 0.25% CHAPSO-HEPES buffer and incubated for 4 h at 37¬∞C with lipids and 1 ¬µM of recombinant human APP-based substrate (C100-Flag). Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunostained with anti-Flag (M2) or anti-PS1 (MAB1563). The relative amounts of AICD-Flag generated in the reactions, reflecting Œ≥-secretase activity, were estimated by densitometry. PS1 immunostaining was used to assess the amount of input material. (B) Equal amounts of microsomal proteins were immunoprecipitated overnight at 4¬∞C with either anti-Flag M2 or anti-HA affinity resins, and submitted to a C100-His assay according to the same protocol as in (A). Protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and analysed by immunostaining for Œ≥-secretase subunits ((NCT164 (NCT), MAB1563 (PS1-NTF), or UD1 (PEN2)). AICD-His cleavage products were immunostained with an anti-APP-CTF antibody (A8717). *Indicates a non-specific band corresponding to the IgG light chains. (C) AŒ≤1‚Äì40 and AŒ≤1‚Äì42 were quantified by sandwich ELISA and represented in pg/mL (left Y-axis) or in percentage (right Y-axis) of the mean of AŒ≤1‚Äì40 levels generated by the two wild-type clones. AŒ≤1‚Äì42/AŒ≤1‚Äì40 ratios are indicated on the top of the bars. The results were confirmed in three independent experiments and a representative dataset is shown.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0035133.g003 We next performed activity assays under semi-purified conditions. To do so, Œ≥-secretase complexes from the different clones were co-immunoprecipitated from microsomal extracts and their activities were assayed in vitro with the C100-His substrate. Two immunoprecipitation protocols using two affinity resins (anti-Flag M2 and anti-HA 3F10, targeting respectively Flag-PEN2 and APH1aL-HA) were compared to exclude a possible heterogeneity of Œ≥-secretase complexes potentially generated under such conditions. As shown in Figure 3B, the anti-Flag and anti-HA resins immunoprecipitated similar levels of NCT, PS1 and PEN2 and the activity of the Œ≥-secretase complexes was similar regardless of the affinity resins used (Figures 3B). In agreement with the assays performed using microsomal extracts (Figure 3A), those performed with semi-purified complexes revealed that FAD-linked mutants drastically reduced AICD generation, when compared to PS1-WT (Figure 3B). Furthermore, levels of AŒ≤1‚Äì40 produced from PS1-L166P, PS1-ŒîE9 and P436Q variants fell respectively to ~6%, ~1.5% and ~0.5%, when compared to these produced from PS1-WT Œ≥-secretase. Following the same tendency, AŒ≤1‚Äì42 levels generated from PS1-L166P, PS1-ŒîE9 and PS1-P436Q Œ≥-secretase variants were respectively estimated to ~20%, ~5% and ~3% of these produced with PS1-WT-containing complexes. The AŒ≤1-42/AŒ≤1‚Äì40 ratio measured for WT Œ≥-MEFs was consistent with our cell-based data (compare Figures 2D and 3C), validating our in vitro experimental conditions. Interestingly, an overall AŒ≤1‚Äì42/AŒ≤1‚Äì40 ratio of ~1 was estimated for all PS1 mutants, with the exception of P436Q#4 (~2). However, in the latter, the ratio may have been overestimated because the AŒ≤1‚Äì40 levels measured were at the detection limit. This similarity in the AŒ≤1‚Äì42/AŒ≤1‚Äì40 ratios generated by the different mutantshas, to the best of our knowledge, never been observed in previous studies.Highly purified Œ≥-secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 mutants display a loss-of-function phenotypeIn order to further investigate how PS1 variants affect APP-CTF cleavage and to validate our observations performed in semi-purified conditions, we purified to homogeneity Œ≥-secretase complexes from the selected clones described in Figure 1. The purification process (described in details under Materials &amp; Methods and depicted in Figure 4A) involved three sequential affinity purifications starting from microsomal extracts. Since all cell lines were generated on a PS knockout background, this strategy allowed us to purify exclusively and selectively Œ≥-secretase complexes made of human components. As highlighted in Figure 4B, our protocol led to the production of stable, high molecular weight Œ≥-secretase complexes (HMWCs) with an apparent molecular mass on Blue Native (BN)-PAGE of ~350 kDa, which is consistent with previous reports [26], [27], [37]. The silver stained particles on the BN gel confirmed the high purity of these complexes (Figure 4B, upper panel), for which the identity was established by cross-reactivity with antibodies specific to NCT and PS1 (Figure 4B, lower panels). As the main goal of this experiment was to compare the efficacy of the different Œ≥-secretase complexes to process APP-based substrates, it is important to note that the final yields of the complexes purified from the different clones were very similar (Figure 4B), thus facilitating further comparative analyses. The immunoblot analysis of the purified complexes (Figure 4C) confirmed the presence of all core components (NCT-V5, APH1aL-HA, Flag-PEN2 and PS1) and globally recapitulates the maturation processes observed in the Figure 1. Interestingly, the relative PS1-NTF/CTF to PS1-FL ratios in the purified Œ≥-secretase complexes containing the three PS1 dominant-negative or the PS1-P436Q variants were higher than those estimated in the whole cell extracts before purification (Figure 1A), indicating that endoproteolysis of PS1 was not completely abolished by these mutations. To assess how FAD-linked mutations in PS1 affect Œ≥-secretase activity in these purified complexes, we performed in vitro assays by using C100-Flag substrate (Figure 3A) and equal amounts of the different purified complexes, immediately after the purification to avoid freezing/thawing cycles that might affect enzymatic activity. As shown in Figure 5A, Œ≥-secretase activity based on AICD-Flag production was easily detected in complexes purified from the two PS1-WT clones. This is in sharp contrast to the other purified complexes that did not generate detectable AICD under our experimental conditions (Figure 5A). Next, sandwich ELISAs directed against AŒ≤1‚Äì40 and AŒ≤1‚Äì42 were performed in order to further characterize the specific activity of the purified complexes. Reflecting the levels of AICD and considering the detection limits of our sandwich ELISA, the production of both AŒ≤ species by Œ≥-secretase complexes containing PS1-WT was at least 10-fold higher than in complexes with the FAD-linked or dominant-negative PS1 variants (Figure 5B). The AŒ≤1‚Äì42/AŒ≤1‚Äì40 ratio measured in PS1-WT Œ≥-secretase complexes (~0.22) was similar to that previously reported [26], [27], thus excluding a possible qualitative alteration of Œ≥-secretase activity with this protocol. Together, our results strongly support the hypothesis that the pathogenic L166P, ŒîE9, and P436Q mutations in PSEN1 cause a drastic loss (at least 90% as estimated by ELISA) of Œ≥-secretase activity.thumbnailFigure 4. High-grade purification of human Œ≥-secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 mutants.(A) Schematic representation of the Œ≥-secretase purification process. Briefly, Presenilin double-knockout MEFs were used to first generate cell lines that stably overexpress human Œ≥-secretase complexes containing different PS1 variants. Next, these cell lines were used for a multi-step purification procedure as described in the material and methods. (B) Blue-Native PAGE analysis of purified Œ≥-secretase complexes made of different PS1 variants. Equal volumes of the different purified Œ≥-secretase preparations were separated by native-PAGE on a 4‚Äì16% Bis-Tris gel, and stained with silver nitrate (top panel), or immunostained for NCT (NCT164, middle panel) or PS1-NTF (ab10281, bottom panel) as indicated. Œ≥-Secretase complexes appeared on the gel as high molecular weight complexes (HMWCs) of ~350 kDa. Note that the levels of HMWCs were similar for all clones. (C) Equal volumes of purified Œ≥-secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 mutants were separated under denaturing conditions (SDS-PAGE) and immunostained with anti-NCT (NCT164), anti-PS1-NTF (MAB1563), anti-PS1-CTF (MAB5232), anti-HA (3F10), or anti-Flag (M2) antibodies. Two independent purifications were performed on each clone with similar results. A representative dataset is shown.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0035133.g004 thumbnailFigure 5. Enzymatic activity of highly purified Œ≥-secretase complexes with FAD-linked or aspartate PS1 mutants.Equal amounts of the different purified Œ≥-secretase preparations characterized in Figure 4 were tested for activity on C100-Flag, as described in Figure 3. The resulting cleavage products were separated by SDS-PAGE and detected by immunostaining with an anti-Flag antibody (M2) for C100-Flag or AICD-Flag (A), and by sandwich ELISA for AŒ≤1‚Äì40 or AŒ≤1‚Äì42 (B). Note that the levels of AŒ≤ produced from FAD-linked Œ≥-secretase complexes were all in the non-linear range of the ELISA standards, close to the detection limit. Whenever possible, AŒ≤1‚Äì42/AŒ≤1‚Äì40 ratios were quantified and indicated on the top of the bars. Two independent purifications were performed on each clone and similar results were obtained. A representative dataset is shown.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0035133.g005 Discussion Top Several conflicting results as to how Alzheimer's disease-linked mutations in PSEN1 affect the processing of APP by Œ≥-secretase have been reported. First, it has been previously reported that transgenic animals with FAD-linked PS1 mutations show increasing brain levels of AŒ≤1‚Äì42 [15], [38]. Since AŒ≤1‚Äì42, the first AŒ≤ specie deposited in the brain of AD patients [16], [39], is more prone to aggregation when compared to shorter AŒ≤ species [40], [41], [42], it has been implicated in the seeding of amyloid plaques in AD patients with PSEN1 mutations [43]. This was further validated in vivo as the overexpression of PS1 mutants in APP transgenic mice accelerated the rate of AŒ≤ accumulation and deposition in the brain [44], [45]. However, Bentahir and colleagues challenged this view by showing that several PSEN1 mutations were also capable to decrease total AŒ≤ production in PS1/PS2 knockout cells [23]. These findings suggested that endogenous PS1 and PS2 may influence the mutant phenotype in cells or in vivo. By extension, we hypothesized that the other components of Œ≥-secretase, namely APH1, NCT and PEN2, may influence the mutant phenotype as well. Indeed, Œ≥-secretase complexes are heterogeneous in composition due to the existence of two human APH1 genes, APH1a and APH1b, and two splicing isoforms of APH1a (S and L), as well as two presenilin genes, PSEN1 and PSEN2. Therefore, it is plausible that a single mutation in PSEN1 confers different catalytic properties to distinct Œ≥-secretase subtypes. This hypothesis is supported by recent investigations showing that APH1 variants can modulate AŒ≤ profiles. When compared to APH1aS or L, overexpression of APH1b in MEF knockout for all APH1 genes led to increased production of longer AŒ≤ species [24]. With this regard, it is important to note that all four mouse variants of APH1 are expressed in the MEF cell line used in previous studies [23] and employed here (cf. Figure S3). Since the phenotype of PS1 mutations have mainly been assessed in vivo or in cell-based systems, we investigated the effects of FAD-linked PS1 mutants on the processing of APP-CTFs in cell-free systems, by using semi-purified and purified enzymatic complexes isolated from MEF PS1/PS2 double knockout cells stably overexpressing differentially tagged human Œ≥-secretase components. Under these conditions, the biochemical and functional properties of Œ≥-secretase complexes bearing either FAD-linked PS1 mutants (L166P, ŒîE9, and P436Q), dominant-negative forms of PS1 or wild-type PS1 were characterized. The activity of Œ≥-secretase with PS1-WT was similar to that reported for Œ≥-secretase purified from our CHO cells overexpressing NCT-V5, APH1aL, Flag-PEN2 and PS1-WT [26], [27], that resulted in AŒ≤1‚Äì42/AŒ≤1‚Äì40 ratios between 0.1 and 0.3. In contrast, we found a major loss in the activity of Œ≥-secretase complexes containing either the dominant-negative PS1 variants or the FAD-linked PS1 mutants. Although a total loss of activity was expected for the dominant negative forms of Œ≥-secretase [5], [6], [32], the drastic loss of activity seen here with the FAD-linked PS1 mutants was unexpected. Indeed, the PS1-L166P variant has previously been reported to increase AŒ≤1‚Äì42 levels both in vivo [46] and in vitro [20], in the presence of endogenous PS1, PS2 and APH1 components. In contrast, Bentahir and colleagues found that PS1-L166P decreased both AŒ≤1‚Äì40 and AŒ≤1‚Äì42 production in a PS knockout background. These results are consistent with our in vitro data, although the reduction in AŒ≤1‚Äì42 and AŒ≤1‚Äì40 production was more pronounced in our system. However, they differ from our cell-based data in which we observed an increase in AŒ≤1‚Äì42 associated with a decrease in AŒ≤1‚Äì40. Taken together, these data suggest that the overexpression of the other human components of Œ≥-secretase can influence the phenotype of FAD-linked mutations. Another possible explanation for these discrepancies comes from the use, in previously described cellular systems, of APP carrying the Swedish mutation (K670M/N671L) [20], [23], [46]. Initially, this APP variant was shown to enhance the production of all AŒ≤ species by favouring its Œ≤-secretase cleavage [47], [48]. However, Munter and colleagues recently demonstrated that the APP Swedish mutation can also affect the specificity of the Œ≥-secretase cleavage [49]. In particular, these authors showed that over-expression of APP Swedish in a neuronal cell line led to a 4-fold increase in secreted AŒ≤42, associated with only a 2-fold increase of total AŒ≤, compared with the wild-type APP. Therefore, one cannot exclude the possibility of differential interactions between PS1-WT or PS1 variants and different APP variants, as suggested earlier [50].As far as the PS1-ŒîE9 mutant is concerned, previous cell-based studies have reported a decrease in AŒ≤40 levels associated with an increase in AŒ≤42 levels [51], [52], or no changes in AŒ≤40 levels despite increased AŒ≤42 levels [53], or a decrease in both AŒ≤ species [23]. In the present study, AŒ≤1‚Äì40, AŒ≤1‚Äì42, as well as AICD levels generated from purified Œ≥-secretase complexes with PS1-ŒîE9 were close to the limit of detection, resulting in a loss of at least 95% of the Œ≥-secretase activity compared to wild-type PS1. Similarly, we found a near to complete loss of Œ≥-secretase activity for complexes with the aggressive PS1-P436Q mutant (mean onset: 28.3 years) [54]. Consistent with a recent study [35], and in contrast to PS1-L166P, the maturation of the full-length PS1-P436Q protein into PS1-NTF and PS1-CTF was impaired. Interestingly, the same study also reported that P436Q variant showed a decreased Œ≥-secretase activity and AŒ≤40 and AŒ≤42 secretion in PS1/PS2 double knockout cells (~75% or ~50% of the control for AŒ≤40 or AŒ≤42, respectively), but to a lesser extent than what we measured in this study (more than 97% for both AŒ≤ species).Overall, our data show that, under our experimental conditions, the FAD-linked PS1 mutants cause a drastic loss of activity (at least 90%) in the highly purified and homogeneous as well as semi-purified Œ≥-secretase complexes. This loss-of-function is asymmetrical as AŒ≤1‚Äì42 levels were relatively less affected than AŒ≤1‚Äì40 levels. Interestingly, the ratio between the two AŒ≤ species was similar for the variants tested here (~1), suggesting a common modulatory mechanism. Our findings further support a model in which the subtype of Œ≥-secretase containing APH1aL and FAD-linked PS1 mutants generates a higher AŒ≤42/AŒ≤40 ratio compared to PS1-WT, as previously observed in vivo [15], [38]. Taken together, the overall reduction in AŒ≤ levels strongly suggest that other regulatory mechanisms or cellular components may exist and account for the strong amyloid pathology observed in AD patients carrying these FAD-linked PSEN1 mutations. In agreement with this hypothesis, we report that the phenotype of FAD-linked PSEN1 mutations is different whether we consider the cell-based or the cell-free conditions. Indeed, even if AŒ≤42/AŒ≤40 ratios were globally increased in both experimental conditions, AŒ≤ production was strikingly different.One possible explanation would be that specific subtypes of Œ≥-secretase complexes are less affected than others by PSEN1 mutations. For instance, it remains unknown whether Œ≥-secretase complexes carrying APH1b or APH1aS are similarly affected by PSEN1 mutations. In support to that regard, Winkler and colleagues recently purified human Œ≥-secretase with PS1-L166P and observed that such complexes, containing both APH1a and AHP1b, led to increased AŒ≤1‚Äì42 production associated with decreased AŒ≤1‚Äì40 production, as compared to the PS1-WT complexes. Another possible explanation would be that purified Œ≥-secretase complexes lack binding partners modulating the processing of APP-based substrates, due to purification conditions affecting physical interactions of proteins. These include TMP21 or the recently reported Œ≥-secretase activating protein (GSAP) [12], [13]. Further biochemical analyses are needed to test this hypothesis.The loss of activity in Œ≥-secretase containing PS1 variants also leads to decreased generation of AICD. As AICD is involved in the transcriptional regulation of several genes, including the neprilysin [55], and the lipoprotein receptor, LRP1 [11], it is likely that mutations in PSEN1 impair the regulation of these genes in vivo. For instance, it is possible that unknown genes transcriptionally regulated in vivo by the AICD might influence AŒ≤ metabolism in return. In support to these views, Veeraraghavalu and colleagues recently demonstrated that Notch signalling was impaired in transgenic mice overexpressing PS1 mutants, albeit in the presence of endogenous PS1-WT and all APH1 isoforms [56]. They found decreased self-renewal and differentiation of neuronal precursor cells in the subventricular zone, suggesting that the loss-of-function phenotype of PSEN1 mutations can also be observed in heterogeneous conditions. These results are reminiscent of the previous report from Saura and colleagues showing that conditional inactivation of both presenilins in vivo induces age-dependent neurodegeneration associated with memory impairment [57]. Altogether, the above-described data suggest that alternative pathways of neurodegeneration related to loss of Œ≥-secretase functions are possible and relevant to AD. They further support the concept that modulating rather than inhibiting Œ≥-secretase activity would be a more appropriate therapeutic strategy for AD [58]. Supporting this view, the Œ≥-secretase inhibitor Semagacestat tested in phase III clinical trials not only failed to slow cognitive decline in patients with mild-to-moderate AD, but actually made it worse [59].Collectively, our findings support a model in which FAD-linked mutations in PSEN1 likely induce AŒ≤ pathology by perturbing the relative ratio between AŒ≤ species and by impairing developmental and cellular signalling pathways controlled by Œ≥-secretase substrates. This deleterious dual effect might explain why FAD-linked PSEN1 mutations cause early onset Alzheimer's disease. Since it has been established that AŒ≤ and AICD are generated following the processing by Œ≥-secretase at two distinct gamma- and epsilon-cleavage sites in APP [60], further investigation is now required to better understand whether and how FAD mutations in PS1 differentially affect the epsilon versus gamma-cleavage sites in APP, as well as in other known Œ≥-secretase substrates.Materials and Methods Top DNA Constructs and mutagenesisNCT-V5, Flag-PEN2, APH1aL-HA, wild-type PS1 human cDNAs (PS1-WT) were obtained from D. Selkoe (Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA). PS1 ŒîE9 cDNA was obtained from C. Saura (Universitat Aut√≤noma de Barcelona, Spain). PS1 D257A and PS1 D385A cDNAs were obtained from M. Wolfe (Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA). Mutations in PSEN1, namely, L166P and P436Q, were generated by PCR-based mutagenesis on the plasmid pcDNA3.1/Zeo(+)-PS1-WT using T7 or BGH primers (specific to the plasmid DNA sequence) together with the corresponding primers: L166P Rv: 5‚Ä≤ CAG CAA CAA Taa gct tGA TAT AAT AGG 3‚Ä≤; L166P Fw: 5‚Ä≤ CTT ATT ATA TCa agc ttA TTG TTG CTG 3‚Ä≤; P436Q Rv: 5‚Ä≤ TCG AGT TTA Gaa gct tTC TTG AAA ATG GCA AGG AG 3‚Ä≤; P436Q Fw: 5‚Ä≤ TCG AGT TTA Gaa gct tTG CCA GCT CTT CAA ATC TCC 3‚Ä≤. The sequences corresponding to enzyme restriction sites are given in small letters. The PCR fragments were next digested with BamHI/HindIII and HindIII/XhoI respectively, and were subcloned into pcDNA3. PS1 D257A/D385A (DDAA) was obtained by subcloning the DraI/XhoI digested fragment of PS1 D385A into pcDNA3.1-PS1 D257A. The APP based substrate SPA4CT-Flag, corresponding to the signal peptide of APP fused to the APP-C99-Flag with a small linker region (DA) [36], was obtained by removing the HindIII/EcoRI fragment of pcDNA3-APP695-Flag and inserting the following annealed primers: 5‚Ä≤ AGC TTA TGC TGC CCG GTT TG GCA CTG CTC CTG CTG GCC GCC TGG ACG GCT CGG GCG GAT GCA GAT GCA G 3‚Ä≤ and 5‚Ä≤ AAT TCT GCA TCT GCA TCC GCC CGA GCC GTC CAG GCG GCC AGC AGG AGC AGT GCC AAA CCG GGC AGC ATA 3‚Ä≤. All constructs were next subcloned into the self-inactivated vector pSIN-PGK-WHV cassette (a kind gift from R. Zufferey, Brain Mind Institute, EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland). Inserts for plasmids pET21-C100-Flag, and pET21-C100-His were generated by PCR as previously described [27]. Plasmids pMD2G and psPAX2 were obtained from D. Trono (Global Health Institute, EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland).Lentivector productionReplication-defective lentiviral particles were produced by a three-plasmid transient transfection of cells from the human embryonic kidney HEK 293T cell line [61]. Briefly, cells were incubated in 10 cm dishes until they reached 70% confluence and were transiently co-transfected by the calcium phosphate method, with 5 ¬µg of envelope plasmid (pMD2G), 15 ¬µg of packaging plasmid (psPAX2), and 20 ¬µg of vector plasmids (pSIN-PGK-WHV). Cells were incubated overnight with DNA-calcium precipitates, washed twice with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Invitrogen) and incubated with 7 mL of DMEM. After 24 h, the conditioned medium was harvested and cells were incubated a second time with 7 mL of DMEM for 24 h. Media were then pooled, passed through 0.45 ¬µm filter, and stored at ‚àí80¬∞C as 2 mL aliquots until use. A p24 ELISA (Zeptometrix corporation) was performed on each batch of media in order to evaluate the number of viral particles generated.Generation of stable cell lines through multiple gene transductionsMouse Embryonic Fibroblasts (MEFs, obtained from B. De Strooper, Flanders University Institute of Biotechnology, Belgium) defective in PSEN1 and PSEN2 [30], [31] were cultivated in 10 cm dishes in DMEM, supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS) and penicillin/streptomycin (P/S) (Invitrogen). A first set of stable cell lines was generated by co-transducing NCT-V5, APH1aL-HA, and Flag-PEN2 containing lentiviral vectors (LV) repeatedly for two weeks at each passage (1/20). Ten clones were isolated by the limiting dilution method and were further screened for NCT-V5, Flag-PEN2 and APH1aL-HA expression by immunodetection. The clone that showed the highest expression of the three proteins (designated Œ≥ - PS1/2) was used as the parental cell line to generate the stable cell lines expressing different PS1 variants, by the same method and by using lentiviral vectors carrying human PS1-WT, PS1-L166P, PS1-ŒîE9, PS1-P436Q, PS1-D257A, PS1-D385A, and PS1-DDAA. For each PS1 variant, five clones were selected for a full characterization and two of them were further used for Œ≥-secretase purification. For SPA4CT overexpression experiments, 500,000 cells of each clone were exposed to the same arbitrary dose of lentiviral vectors carrying human SPA4CT-Flag in 2 mL of DMEM, 1% FBS, P/S and were plated in 6-wells plates for 72 h. The medium was next replaced by fresh DMEM, 2% FBS, P/S for 24 h. Finally, cell culture medium was harvested, supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche), centrifuged for 3 min at 1,000√ó rpm and frozen at ‚àí80¬∞C until further processing. Cells were washed in PBS and submitted to protein extraction.Protein extractionTotal protein extracts were prepared in 1% NP40 - HEPES buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM CaCl2), supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche), and were clarified by centrifugation for 1 h at 16,000√ó g, 4¬∞C. Cell membranes were obtained as described below and solubilised in 1% CHAPSO - HEPES buffer and centrifuged at 16,000√ó g for 1 h. Supernatants corresponding to the microsomal protein extracts were harvested and stored at ‚àí80¬∞C. Protein content of the extracts was estimated by the BCA protein assay reagent kit (Pierce).Multi-step purification of human Œ≥-secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 variants1) Cell membrane preparation. MEF PS1/PS2 DKO cells (1.0√ó109 cells) expressing NCT-V5, Flag-PEN2, APH1aL-HA and different forms of PS1: wild type (WT), or with FAD-linked variants or lacking the critical aspartate residues, were collected from 15 cm dishes and fully resuspended in 40 mL of MES buffer (50 mM MES, pH 6.0, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM CaCl2), supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). Next, cells were passed four times through a high-pressure homogenizer (Emulsiflex-C5, Avestin Inc, ON Canada) at a pressure greater than 1,000 psi. Nuclei and unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation at 3,000√ó g for 20 min at 4¬∞C in a Beckman Coulter Allegra X-15R centrifuge. The supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 100,000√ó g for 1 h at 4¬∞C in a SW32Ti rotor using a Beckman Coulter Optima L-80 ultracentrifuge to recover the membrane preparation in the pellet. 2) Bicarbonate wash. The membrane pellet was fully resuspended in 1.6 mL of ice cold sodium bicarbonate buffer (0.1 M NaHCO3, pH 11.3) by pipetting up and down at least 30 times, and incubated at 4¬∞C for 20 min. The washed membranes were then centrifuged at 100,000√ó g for 1 h at 4¬∞C and stored at ‚àí80¬∞C until use. 3) Solubilisation of Œ≥-secretase complexes. The bicarbonate-washed membranes were fully resuspended in 1.7 mL of 1% CHAPSO - HEPES buffer by pipetting up and down at least 30 times. The membranes were then incubated at 4¬∞C for 1 h. To pellet the insoluble material, the solution was centrifuged at 16,000√ó g at 4¬∞C for 1 h, the pellet was discarded, and the supernatant saved. This lysate is defined as ‚Äúsolubilised Œ≥-secretase preparation‚Äù. Next, these freshly prepared solubilised preparations were used for affinity purification of Œ≥-secretase complexes as described below. 4) Anti-Flag M2 affinity purification. The solubilised Œ≥-secretase preparations were first diluted 1:2 with HEPES buffer, and further diluted 1:6 with 0.1% digitonin - TBS buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl) (final detergent concentration: 0.08% CHAPSO, 0.08% digitonin) and incubated overnight at 4¬∞C with agitation after adding 200 ¬µL of anti-Flag M2 affinity resin beads (Sigma-Aldrich) that had been pre-equilibrated in 0.1% Digitonin - TBS buffer. The beads were washed 3 times in the same buffer, and the bound proteins were eluted over 4 h at 4¬∞C with 0.4 mL of this buffer containing 200 ¬µg/mL of Flag peptides (Sigma-Aldrich). This elution step was repeated once for 1 h at 4¬∞C and the eluted fractions were pooled and designated ‚ÄúM2 pooled 800 ¬µL fractions‚Äù. 5) Anti-V5 affinity purification. The M2 pooled fractions (volume made up to 1 mL with 0.1% Digitonin - TBS buffer) were next incubated overnight at 4¬∞C under agitation with 200 ¬µL of anti-V5 affinity resin beads (Sigma-Aldrich), pre-equilibrated in 0.1% digitonin-TBS buffer. The beads were washed 3 times in the same buffer, and the bound proteins were eluted for 1 h at 4¬∞C with 0.4 mL of this buffer containing 500 ¬µg/mL of V5 peptides (Sigma-Aldrich). This elution step was repeated 4 times, and the eluted fractions were pooled and designated ‚ÄúV5 pooled 1.6 mL fractions‚Äù. 6) Anti-HA affinity purification. As a final purification step, the V5 pooled fractions (volume made up to 1.8 mL with 0.1% digitonin - TBS buffer) were next incubated overnight at 4¬∞C under agitation with 200 ¬µL of anti-HA affinity resin beads (Sigma-Aldrich), pre-equilibrated in 0.1% digitonin - TBS buffer. The beads were washed 3 times in the same buffer, and the bound proteins were eluted overnight at 4¬∞C with 0.2 mL of this buffer containing 200 ¬µg/mL of HA peptides (Sigma-Aldrich). This elution step was repeated once, for 1 h at 4¬∞C, and the two eluted fractions were kept separately, designated ‚ÄúHA fraction E1‚Äù and ‚ÄúHA fraction E2‚Äù.Co-immunoprecipitationCo-IPs were performed on microsomal protein extracts. Briefly, 100 ¬µg of proteins were diluted in a final volume of 1 mL of 1% CHAPSO - HEPES extraction buffer containing protease inhibitors (Roche), and 50 ¬µL of pre-equilibrated anti-Flag or anti-HA affinity beads (Sigma-Aldrich) were added. Samples were next incubated overnight at 4¬∞C on a rotator wheel and were washed three times in 0.2% CHAPSO - HEPES buffer. Finally, beads were resuspended in 50 ¬µL of 0.2% CHAPSO - HEPES buffer and were used for in vitro Œ≥-secretase assays.In vitro Œ≥-secretase activity assaysIn vitro Œ≥-secretase activity assays were performed as previously described [27]. Œ≥-Secretase APP-based substrates were expressed in E. coli transfected with plasmids pET21-C100-Flag or pET21-C100-His as a fusion protein consisting of a Met for translation initiation, and either the Flag tag sequence (C100-Flag) or the His tag sequence (C100-His), and were affinity purified using an anti-Flag resin (M2, Sigma-Aldrich) or an Ni-NTA agarose resin (Invitrogen), respectively. In vitro assays were performed at 37¬∞C for 4 h, with 1 ¬µM of recombinant substrate, 0.025% phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and 0.1% phosphatidylcholine (PC). Œ≥-Secretase activity was quantified by measuring the amount of AICD and AŒ≤ generated during the reaction, by immunoblot or sandwich ELISA respectively, as described below.SDS-PAGE, Native PAGE, Western blotting and antibodiesTotal or microsomal protein extracts were resolved by electrophoresis on NuPAGE¬Æ Novex¬Æ 4‚Äì12% Bis-Tris Gels (Invitrogen) or on standard 12% acrylamide/bisacrylamide Tris Glycine gels for SDS-PAGE analysis. Purified Œ≥-secretase was resolved by electrophoresis on NativePAGE‚Ñ¢ Novex¬Æ Bis-Tris 4‚Äì16% Gels for Blue Native (BN)-PAGE analysis (Invitrogen). Silver staining was performed directly on gel according to manufacturer instructions (Biorad). For immunoblot analysis, gels were transferred to nitrocellulose or PVDF membranes (Whatman), and probed with the following antibodies: anti-Nicastrin NCT164 (BD Bioscience), anti-V5-tag for NCT-V5 (Covance), MAB1563 (Millipore) or ab10281 (Abcam) for PS1 NTF, MAB5232 for PS1 CTF (Millipore), 3F10 for APH1aL-HA (Roche), anti-Flag M2 for Flag-PEN-2 or C100-Flag (Sigma-Aldrich), A8717 for APP CTF (Sigma-Aldrich), and A2066 for Œ≤-actin (Sigma-Aldrich). Anti-mouse/rabbit/rat IgG conjugated to Alexa 680 were purchased from Invitrogen. The Odyssey infrared imaging system (LICOR) was used to detect the fluorescent signal.Quantification of AŒ≤ peptidesAŒ≤ peptides from the Œ≥-secretase assays described above were quantified by sandwich ELISA according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. Three kits were used to detect human AŒ≤1‚Äì40(Invitrogen KHB3481) and AŒ≤1‚Äì42 (Invitrogen KHB3544 and Wako 269-64401).Supporting Information Top Figure S1. Characterization of stable cell lines overexpressing human FAD-linked PS1 variants in MEF PS1/2‚àí/‚àí. Presenilin double-knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts were stably transduced with lentiviral vectors carrying genes encoding hPS1 variants harbouring FAD-linked mutations or mutations in the catalytic aspartate residue(s), or PS1-WT, and cloned. Two clones per PS1 variant were selected for characterization. (A) Whole cell protein extracts of the different cell lines were prepared in 1% NP40-HEPES buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE on 12% Tris-Glycine gels and analysed by immunostaining with various antibodies to detect the endogenous Œ≥-secretase core components: NCT (NCT164), hPS1 (NTF, MAB1563), and PEN2 (UD1), and with an antibody for APP (A8717). Œ≤-Actin was used as a loading control. Each lane represents one selected clone. (B) Œ≥-Secretase activity assays were performed with microsomal extracts prepared in 1% CHAPSO-HEPES buffer. Equal protein levels from the different extracts were diluted to 0.25% CHAPSO-HEPES buffer and incubated for 4 h at 37¬∞C with lipids and 1 ¬µM of recombinant human APP-based substrate (C100-Flag). Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunostained with anti-Flag (M2) or anti-PS1 (MAB1563). PS1 immunostaining was used to assess the amount of input material. * Indicates a non-specific band, which was not detected in microsomal protein extracts of the same cell lines using the same antibody (MAB1563) (B).

Cell proteins were extracted in 1% NP40-HEPES buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE on 12% Tris-Glycine gels and analysed by immunostaining with an antibody targeting the C-terminal part of APP (A8717).(TIF)Figure S3. APH1 isoforms expressed in MEF PS1/2‚àí/‚àí. Total RNAs were extracted from presenilin double-knockout MEFs, using standard procedures (Qiagen RNAeasy kit) and were quantified by spectrophotometry. One microgram of total RNAs was reverse transcribed for 1 h at 42¬∞C by using the ImProm-II reverse transcription system (Promega) and oligo-dT primer in a final volume of 20 ¬µL. PCR was next performed for each APH1 isoform on 1 ¬µL of RT reaction by using the Roche PCR kit under standard conditions and the primers described in Table S1. The following cycling conditions were applied for all reactions: 94¬∞C, 3 min; 30 cycles of [94¬∞C, 30 s; 58¬∞C, 30 s; 70¬∞C, 40 s]; 70¬∞C, 10 min.

(FAD) [1], [2], the presenilin genes PSEN1 and PSEN2 have been widely studied, and the complexity of their biological role is becoming increasingly evident.&#10;PSEN1 and PSEN2 encode transmembrane proteins PS1 and PS2, respectively, that constitute the catalytic core of Œ≥-secretase, the founding member of an emerging class of unconventional, Intramembrane-Cleaving Proteases (I-CLiPs) [3].&#10;Active Œ≥-secretase is a multiprotein complex composed of PS1 or PS2 together with nicastrin (NCT), the anterior pharynx-defective protein 1 (APH1), and the presenilin enhancer 2 (PEN2).&#10;Experimental evidence such as the binding of transition-state analogue Œ≥-secretase inhibitors to PS1 [4], as well as the abolishment of Œ≥-secretase activity when PS1 lacks the aspartate residues critical for proteolysis [4], [5], [6], have confirmed that presenilins harbour the active site of the enzymatic complex.&#10;PS1 and PS2 play fundamental roles in cell signalling as part of the Œ≥-secretase complex.&#10;The latter cleaves numerous type-I membrane proteins in their transmembrane domain [7], releasing their corresponding intracellular domains, which are capable of influencing gene expression.&#10;For some substrates like NOTCH1 or ERBB4, the Œ≥-secretase cleavage is essential for their biological function, whereas for other substrates like DCC or NEUREXIN-3Œ≤ [8], the possible role of the cleavage in signalling events has not been formally established (see [9] for a review).&#10;The amyloid precursor protein (APP) is processed by the successive actions of Œ≤-secretase (BACE1) and Œ≥-secretase, generating amyloid-beta peptides (AŒ≤) of different lengths, ranging from 37 to 46 amino acids [10].&#10;Cleavage of the APP C-terminal fragments (APP-CTFs) by Œ≥-secretase also releases the APP intracellular domain (AICD), which has been recently involved in the regulation of brain ApoE expression, a major genetic determinant of AD, and in cholesterol metabolism [11].&#10;In addition, PS1 has been shown to interact with a growing list of proteins that modulate Œ≥-secretase activity [9], [12], [13], [14].&#10;In a pathological context, 185 missense mutations in PSEN1 and 13 mutations in PSEN2 have been identified and found to be associated with FAD (www.molgen.ua.ac.be/ADMutations).&#10;It was initially suggested that such mutations lead to a toxic gain of function because they are associated with a relative increased production of longer and more hydrophobic AŒ≤ species, mainly AŒ≤1‚Äì42, that accumulate and aggregate early in the course of thedisease [15], [16].&#10;Similar phenotypes have been observed by independent groups in cell-based studies performed with different mammalian cell lines [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22].&#10;Despite this growing consensus, the above-mentioned studies provided conflicting results regarding the relative proportions of AŒ≤42, AŒ≤40, and AICD resulting from the PSEN mutations.&#10;On one hand, a gain-of-function phenotype was suggested due to the observed increase in AŒ≤42 production, accompanied or not with reduced AŒ≤40 production, thereby leading to an increased AŒ≤42/AŒ≤40 ratio.&#10;On the other hand, reduced AICD production suggested a loss-of-function phenotype [20].&#10;Differences in the methodologies and cell types used to assess the effects of PSEN mutations on AŒ≤ and AICD productions can explain this controversy as to how PS mutations exert their effects.&#10;For example, endogenous PS has been suggested to affect such analysis, as the FAD-linked PSEN1 mutations led to a decrease in the total amount of AŒ≤ generated in PS1 and PS2 double knockout cells [23].&#10;Next, it has been reported that Œ≥-secretase complexes are heterogeneous in composition (with two PS genes and three APH1 isoforms, six combinations of Œ≥-secretase are possible), with distinct functional properties influencing the relative amount of AŒ≤ species generated [24].&#10;In order to investigate the biochemical and functional properties of Œ≥-secretase in cell-free systems, we and others have recently purified this enzymatic complex to homogeneity [25], [26], [27].&#10;In particular, protocols for the high-grade purification of proteolytically active Œ≥-secretase constituted of NCT, APH1aL, PEN2 and wild-type PS1 [26], [27] allowed the reconstitution of 3D structures at 15 √Ö and 12 √Ö resolution by EM and cryo-EM and gave new insights on the structure and activity of the enzyme [28], [29].&#10;However, these studies were exclusively focused on the wild-type PS1.&#10;Here, we report for the first time the functional characterization of highly purified and homogenous human Œ≥-secretase particles carrying different FAD-linked PS1 mutants.&#10;Our biochemical and functional findings strongly suggest that pathogenic mutations in PSEN1 cause a loss of Œ≥-secretase activity.&#10;Results Top Generation, selection and characterization of stable cell lines overexpressing Œ≥-secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 mutantsIn order to facilitate high-grade purification of homogenous human Œ≥-secretase complexes containing different PS1 variants, we took advantage of a previously generated mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cell line that lacks the two presenilins (PS1/2‚àí/‚àí) [30], [31].&#10;Our global strategy consisted in producing stable cell lines, on a PS1/2‚àí/‚àí background, that overexpress tagged versions of the three human Œ≥-secretase subunits NCT, APH1 and PEN2 together with different variants of human PS1, and to purify the different human Œ≥-secretase complexes by three sequential affinity purification steps.&#10;This strategy allowed us to exclude a possible co-purification of mouse Œ≥-secretase components.&#10;First, a parental cell line was generated by co-transducing lentiviral vectors of human NCT-V5 (hNCT-V5), human APH1aL-HA (hAPH1aL-HA) and human Flag-PEN2 (Flag-hPEN2) into MEF PS1/2‚àí/‚àí.&#10;Lentivectors are stably integrated into the cell genome and allow the generation of cell lines overexpressing multiple genes in a short period of time.&#10;Next, the clone expressing the highest levels of all three recombinant proteins was selected (designated Œ≥ - PS1/2) and used as the parental cell line that was further transduced with lentivectors carrying the following different human PS1 variants: PS1-WT, three dominant-negative forms of PS1 that lack the crucial, catalytic site aspartate residues (D257A, D385A, and both D257A/D385A referred to as DDAA later in the article), and three FAD-linked PS1 mutants (L166P, ŒîE9 and P436Q, with mean disease onset at 24 years, 45.5 years and 28.3 years, respectively).&#10;For each PS1 variant, two individual clones were selected based on the expression levels of the recombinant proteins, and extensively characterized (Figure 1).&#10;To distinguish those cell lines overexpressing all Œ≥-sectease components from wild-type MEFs, they are collectively designated Œ≥-MEFs.&#10;As shown in Figure 1A, the analysis of total protein extracts confirmed that PS is required for the maturation of NCT and the stability of PEN2 [23], [32].&#10;As expected, and when compared to the parental Œ≥- PS1/2 cell line, higher levels of the mature form of NCT were observed in all PS1-overexpressing clones.&#10;In contrast to PEN2, APH1aL levels were relatively similar in all PS1 clones and the parental cell line.&#10;Indeed, and as previously reported [23], [32], PEN2 levels were higher in the clones overexpressing WT PS1 and FAD-linked PS1 mutants, and to a lesser extent in the clones overexpressing the dominant negative forms of PS1.&#10;Interestingly, PEN2 migrated on the gel as an apparent double band, possibly reflecting a post-translational modification.&#10;Different patterns of PS1 expression and autoproteolysis were observed in the different clones.&#10;First, and in sharp contrast to the other clones, those expressing PS1-WT or PS1-L166P displayed higher levels of PS1-NTF and PS1-CTF fragments compared with full-length PS1 (PS1-FL; Figure 1A).&#10;As estimated by densitometry, the NTF fragments of PS1-WT and PS1-L166P account for 87¬±2% and 79¬±7% of total PS1 (PS1-NTF+PS1-FL), respectively.&#10;Next, the PS1-ŒîE9 clones did not show any detectable NTF or CTF fragments, as previously described [33], while P436Q and the three dominant negative variants of PS1 were characterized by low levels of PS1-NTF and PS1-CTF fragments, suggesting that these variants were less prone to endoproteolysis.&#10;Generation of stable cell lines overexpressing all human Œ≥-secretase components with FAD-linked PS1 variants.&#10;MEF PS1/2‚àí/‚àí were stably co-transduced with lentiviral vectors carrying genes encoding hNCT-V5, Flag-hPEN2, hAPH1aL-HA and clones were isolated by limiting dilution to generate a cell line, designated as Œ≥- PS1/2, that overexpresses high amount of the three subunits.&#10;Œ≥- PS1/2 MEFs were further transduced with hPS1 variants harbouring FAD-linked mutations or mutations in the catalytic aspartate residue(s), or PS1-WT, and cloned.&#10;Each clone, derived form the Œ≥- PS1/2, was conveniently named according to the mutation present in PS1 preceded by the symbol Œ≥ and followed by the number of the clone (Œ≥-MEF) in order to distinguish them from wild-type MEF (WT MEF) and MEF PS1/2‚àí/‚àí.&#10;Two clones per Œ≥-secretase variant were selected for characterization.&#10;(A‚ÄìB) Whole cell protein extracts of the different cell lines were prepared in 1% NP40-HEPES buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE on 4‚Äì12% Bis-Tris or 12% Tris-Glycine gels and analysed by immunostaining to detect the Œ≥-secretase core components NCT (NCT164), PS1 (NTF, MAB1563; CTF; MAB5232), APH1aL-HA (3F10), and Flag-PEN2 (M2) (A), and endogenous APP (A8717) (B).&#10;Œ≤-Actin was used as a loading control.&#10;Each lane represents one selected clone.&#10;g001 We next investigated the effects of PSEN1 mutations on the processing of endogenous APP.&#10;As expected, and as indicated by increased levels of intracellular APP-CTFs (a common characteristic among known substrates in response to Œ≥-secretase pharmacological inhibition), the activity of Œ≥-secretase was significantly altered in the PS deficient parental Œ≥ - PS1/2 cell line as well as in all clones expressing dominant negative forms of PS1 (Figure 1B).&#10;In the clones expressing PS1-WT, APP-CTFs were almost undetectable due to high Œ≥-secretase activity, while clones expressing PS1-L166P or PS1-P436Q displayed APP-CTF accumulation.&#10;In PS1-ŒîE9 clones, a mild APP-CTF accumulation was observed (Figure 1B).&#10;Although a poor recovery of Œ≥-secretase activity for the PS1-L166P and a comparatively better performance of PS1-ŒîE9 have been reported by others under similar experimental conditions [23], the potential of PS1-P436Q mutation to restore the processing of endogenous APP-CTFs has never been assessed [34], [35].&#10;Importantly, all observations described above for the cells overexpressing simultaneously hNCT-V5, hAPH1aL-HA, Flag-hPEN2 and the different PS1 variants are very consistent with those made in MEF PS1/2‚àí/‚àí cells overexpressing only the PS1 variants, in the absence of the other Œ≥-secretase components (cf. Figure S1A).&#10;These data suggest that the effect of FAD mutations in PS1 on APP-CTFs accumulation was similar in presence or absence of other human components of the Œ≥-secretase.&#10;Next, we further investigated the effect of PS1 variants on the cellular production/secretion of AŒ≤ species.&#10;For this purpose, and as described elsewhere [36], we used an APP-based Œ≥-secretase substrate with a Flag tag at its C-terminus (SPA4CT-Flag).&#10;This substrate was transduced in the above-described Œ≥-secretase overexpressing stable cell lines (Œ≥-MEFs) as well as in wild-type MEFs, and APP-CTFs and AŒ≤ levels were measured in cell lysate and cell media, respectively (Figure 2).&#10;Under these conditions, the overexpression of SPA4CT-Flag led to an accumulation of two bands corresponding to the exogenous substrate, associated with a concomitant decrease of endogenous APP-CTFs levels (Figure 2A and Figure S2).&#10;As estimated by ELISA, a three-fold increase in AŒ≤1‚Äì40 and AŒ≤1‚Äì42 levels was observed in the cell culture media of cell lines overexpressing human Œ≥-secretase (Œ≥-MEF WT), in comparison to untransduced WT MEFs (Figure 2B).&#10;Next, overexpression of SPA4CT-Flag in Œ≥-MEFs led to the pronounced intracellular accumulation of APP-CTFs in cells overexpressing the PS1 aspartate mutants (Figure 2C), and to the secretion in the cell culture media of different AŒ≤ levels as measured by ELISA (Figure 2D).&#10;First, only traces of both AŒ≤1‚Äì40 and AŒ≤1‚Äì42 were detected in Œ≥-MEFs overexpressing PS1 with aspartate mutants.&#10;Next, Œ≥-MEFs overexpressing PS1 with FAD-linked mutations displayed a pronounced variability in AŒ≤ levels when compared to the wild-type clones.&#10;AŒ≤ production in cell lines overexpressing human Œ≥-secretase components with FAD-linked PS1 variants.&#10;WT MEF, Œ≥-MEF and Œ≥ - PS1/2 were transduced with an APP-based substrate corresponding to the 99 C-terminal residues of human APP fused to the APP signal peptide in N-terminus (SPA4CT [36]) and a Flag Tag in C-terminus.&#10;Cell proteins were extracted in 1% NP40-HEPES buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE on 12% Tris-Glycine gels and analysed by immunostaining with an antibody targeting the C-terminal part of APP (A8717) (A, C).&#10;Data corresponds to three independent experiments (Mean ¬± SEM).&#10;g002 FAD-linked PS1 mutations alter the activity of semi-purified Œ≥-secretase complexesWe next assessed the activity of Œ≥-secretase with FAD-linked PS1 mutations in microsomal extracts of Œ≥-MEFs.&#10;Membrane protein extracts were prepared and Œ≥-secretase activity was assayed on an exogenous recombinant APP-based substrate consisting of the C-terminal 99 amino acid residues of APP, and referred to as C100-Flag (Figure 3A).&#10;The generation of the cleavage product AICD-Flag was detected by Western blot analysis and measured by densitometry.&#10;As shown in Figure 3A, the levels of AICD-Flag generated from the PS1-L166P and PS1-ŒîE9 clones accounted for 42¬±1% and 13¬±6% of that in the PS1-WT clones, respectively.&#10;AICD-Flag was undetectable in the clones expressing PS1-P436Q as well as in the three dominant negative aspartate PS1 variants.&#10;Similar results were observed in MEF PS1/2‚àí/‚àí cells overexpressing only the PS1 variants, in the absence of the other human Œ≥-secretase components (Figure S1B).&#10;Enzymatic activity of partially purified Œ≥-secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 mutants. (A) Œ≥-Secretase activity assays performed with Œ≥-MEF and Œ≥ - PS1/2 microsomal extracts prepared in 1% CHAPSO-HEPES buffer.&#10;Equal protein levels from the different extracts were diluted to 0.25% CHAPSO-HEPES buffer and incubated for 4 h at 37¬∞C with lipids and 1 ¬µM of recombinant human APP-based substrate (C100-Flag).&#10;Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunostained with anti-Flag (M2) or anti-PS1 (MAB1563).&#10;The relative amounts of AICD-Flag generated in the reactions, reflecting Œ≥-secretase activity, were estimated by densitometry.&#10;PS1 immunostaining was used to assess the amount of input material.&#10;(B) Equal amounts of microsomal proteins were immunoprecipitated overnight at 4¬∞C with either anti-Flag M2 or anti-HA affinity resins, and submitted to a C100-His assay according to the same protocol as in (A).&#10;Protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and analysed by immunostaining for Œ≥-secretase subunits ((NCT164 (NCT), MAB1563 (PS1-NTF), or UD1 (PEN2)).&#10;AICD-His cleavage products were immunostained with an anti-APP-CTF antibody (A8717).&#10;*Indicates a non-specific band corresponding to the IgG light chains.&#10;(C) AŒ≤1‚Äì40 and AŒ≤1‚Äì42 were quantified by sandwich ELISA and represented in pg/mL (left Y-axis) or in percentage (right Y-axis) of the mean of AŒ≤1‚Äì40 levels generated by the two wild-type clones.&#10;The results were confirmed in three independent experiments and a representative dataset is shown.&#10;g003 We next performed activity assays under semi-purified conditions.&#10;To do so, Œ≥-secretase complexes from the different clones were co-immunoprecipitated from microsomal extracts and their activities were assayed in vitro with the C100-His substrate.&#10;Two immunoprecipitation protocols using two affinity resins (anti-Flag M2 and anti-HA 3F10, targeting respectively Flag-PEN2 and APH1aL-HA) were compared to exclude a possible heterogeneity of Œ≥-secretase complexes potentially generated under such conditions.&#10;As shown in Figure 3B, the anti-Flag and anti-HA resins immunoprecipitated similar levels of NCT, PS1 and PEN2 and the activity of the Œ≥-secretase complexes was similar regardless of the affinity resins used (Figures 3B).&#10;In agreement with the assays performed using microsomal extracts (Figure 3A), those performed with semi-purified complexes revealed that FAD-linked mutants drastically reduced AICD generation, when compared to PS1-WT (Figure 3B).&#10;Furthermore, levels of AŒ≤1‚Äì40 produced from PS1-L166P, PS1-ŒîE9 and P436Q variants fell respectively to ~6%, ~1.5% and ~0.5%, when compared to these produced from PS1-WT Œ≥-secretase.&#10;Following the same tendency, AŒ≤1‚Äì42 levels generated from PS1-L166P, PS1-ŒîE9 and PS1-P436Q Œ≥-secretase variants were respectively estimated to ~20%, ~5% and ~3% of these produced with PS1-WT-containing complexes.&#10;The AŒ≤1-42/AŒ≤1‚Äì40 ratio measured for WT Œ≥-MEFs was consistent with our cell-based data (compare Figures 2D and 3C), validating our in vitro experimental conditions.&#10;Interestingly, an overall AŒ≤1‚Äì42/AŒ≤1‚Äì40 ratio of ~1 was estimated for all PS1 mutants, with the exception of P436Q#4 (~2).&#10;However, in the latter, the ratio may have been overestimated because the AŒ≤1‚Äì40 levels measured were at the detection limit.&#10;This similarity in the AŒ≤1‚Äì42/AŒ≤1‚Äì40 ratios generated by the different mutantshas, to the best of our knowledge, never been observed in previous studies.&#10;Highly purified Œ≥-secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 mutants display a loss-of-function phenotypeIn order to further investigate how PS1 variants affect APP-CTF cleavage and to validate our observations performed in semi-purified conditions, we purified to homogeneity Œ≥-secretase complexes from the selected clones described in Figure 1.&#10;The purification process (described in details under Materials &amp; Methods and depicted in Figure 4A) involved three sequential affinity purifications starting from microsomal extracts.&#10;Since all cell lines were generated on a PS knockout background, this strategy allowed us to purify exclusively and selectively Œ≥-secretase complexes made of human components.&#10;As highlighted in Figure 4B, our protocol led to the production of stable, high molecular weight Œ≥-secretase complexes (HMWCs) with an apparent molecular mass on Blue Native (BN)-PAGE of ~350 kDa, which is consistent with previous reports [26], [27], [37].&#10;The silver stained particles on the BN gel confirmed the high purity of these complexes (Figure 4B, upper panel), for which the identity was established by cross-reactivity with antibodies specific to NCT and PS1 (Figure 4B, lower panels).&#10;As the main goal of this experiment was to compare the efficacy of the different Œ≥-secretase complexes to process APP-based substrates, it is important to note that the final yields of the complexes purified from the different clones were very similar (Figure 4B), thus facilitating further comparative analyses.&#10;The immunoblot analysis of the purified complexes (Figure 4C) confirmed the presence of all core components (NCT-V5, APH1aL-HA, Flag-PEN2 and PS1) and globally recapitulates the maturation processes observed in the Figure 1.&#10;Interestingly, the relative PS1-NTF/CTF to PS1-FL ratios in the purified Œ≥-secretase complexes containing the three PS1 dominant-negative or the PS1-P436Q variants were higher than those estimated in the whole cell extracts before purification (Figure 1A), indicating that endoproteolysis of PS1 was not completely abolished by these mutations.&#10;To assess how FAD-linked mutations in PS1 affect Œ≥-secretase activity in these purified complexes, we performed in vitro assays by using C100-Flag substrate (Figure 3A) and equal amounts of the different purified complexes, immediately after the purification to avoid freezing/thawing cycles that might affect enzymatic activity.&#10;As shown in Figure 5A, Œ≥-secretase activity based on AICD-Flag production was easily detected in complexes purified from the two PS1-WT clones.&#10;This is in sharp contrast to the other purified complexes that did not generate detectable AICD under our experimental conditions (Figure 5A).&#10;Next, sandwich ELISAs directed against AŒ≤1‚Äì40 and AŒ≤1‚Äì42 were performed in order to further characterize the specific activity of the purified complexes.&#10;Reflecting the levels of AICD and considering the detection limits of our sandwich ELISA, the production of both AŒ≤ species by Œ≥-secretase complexes containing PS1-WT was at least 10-fold higher than in complexes with the FAD-linked or dominant-negative PS1 variants (Figure 5B).&#10;The AŒ≤1‚Äì42/AŒ≤1‚Äì40 ratio measured in PS1-WT Œ≥-secretase complexes (~0.22) was similar to that previously reported [26], [27], thus excluding a possible qualitative alteration of Œ≥-secretase activity with this protocol.&#10;Together, our results strongly support the hypothesis that the pathogenic L166P, ŒîE9, and P436Q mutations in PSEN1 cause a drastic loss (at least 90% as estimated by ELISA) of Œ≥-secretase activity.&#10;High-grade purification of human Œ≥-secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 mutants. (A) Schematic representation of the Œ≥-secretase purification process.&#10;Briefly, Presenilin double-knockout MEFs were used to first generate cell lines that stably overexpress human Œ≥-secretase complexes containing different PS1 variants.&#10;Next, these cell lines were used for a multi-step purification procedure as described in the material and methods.&#10;(B) Blue-Native PAGE analysis of purified Œ≥-secretase complexes made of different PS1 variants.&#10;Equal volumes of the different purified Œ≥-secretase preparations were separated by native-PAGE on a 4‚Äì16% Bis-Tris gel, and stained with silver nitrate (top panel), or immunostained for NCT (NCT164, middle panel) or PS1-NTF (ab10281, bottom panel) as indicated.&#10;Œ≥-Secretase complexes appeared on the gel as high molecular weight complexes (HMWCs) of ~350 kDa.&#10;Note that the levels of HMWCs were similar for all clones.&#10;(C) Equal volumes of purified Œ≥-secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 mutants were separated under denaturing conditions (SDS-PAGE) and immunostained with anti-NCT (NCT164), anti-PS1-NTF (MAB1563), anti-PS1-CTF (MAB5232), anti-HA (3F10), or anti-Flag (M2) antibodies.&#10;Two independent purifications were performed on each clone with similar results.&#10;A representative dataset is shown.&#10;Enzymatic activity of highly purified Œ≥-secretase complexes with FAD-linked or aspartate PS1 mutants.&#10;Equal amounts of the different purified Œ≥-secretase preparations characterized in Figure 4 were tested for activity on C100-Flag, as described in Figure 3.&#10;The resulting cleavage products were separated by SDS-PAGE and detected by immunostaining with an anti-Flag antibody (M2) for C100-Flag or AICD-Flag (A), and by sandwich ELISA for AŒ≤1‚Äì40 or AŒ≤1‚Äì42 (B).&#10;Note that the levels of AŒ≤ produced from FAD-linked Œ≥-secretase complexes were all in the non-linear range of the ELISA standards, close to the detection limit.&#10;Whenever possible, AŒ≤1‚Äì42/AŒ≤1‚Äì40 ratios were quantified and indicated on the top of the bars.&#10;Two independent purifications were performed on each clone and similar results were obtained.&#10;A representative dataset is shown.&#10;g005 Discussion Top Several conflicting results as to how Alzheimer's disease-linked mutations in PSEN1 affect the processing of APP by Œ≥-secretase have been reported.&#10;First, it has been previously reported that transgenic animals with FAD-linked PS1 mutations show increasing brain levels of AŒ≤1‚Äì42 [15], [38].&#10;Since AŒ≤1‚Äì42, the first AŒ≤ specie deposited in the brain of AD patients [16], [39], is more prone to aggregation when compared to shorter AŒ≤ species [40], [41], [42], it has been implicated in the seeding of amyloid plaques in AD patients with PSEN1 mutations [43].&#10;This was further validated in vivo as the overexpression of PS1 mutants in APP transgenic mice accelerated the rate of AŒ≤ accumulation and deposition in the brain [44], [45].&#10;However, Bentahir and colleagues challenged this view by showing that several PSEN1 mutations were also capable to decrease total AŒ≤ production in PS1/PS2 knockout cells [23].&#10;These findings suggested that endogenous PS1 and PS2 may influence the mutant phenotype in cells or in vivo.&#10;By extension, we hypothesized that the other components of Œ≥-secretase, namely APH1, NCT and PEN2, may influence the mutant phenotype as well.&#10;Indeed, Œ≥-secretase complexes are heterogeneous in composition due to the existence of two human APH1 genes, APH1a and APH1b, and two splicing isoforms of APH1a (S and L), as well as two presenilin genes, PSEN1 and PSEN2.&#10;Therefore, it is plausible that a single mutation in PSEN1 confers different catalytic properties to distinct Œ≥-secretase subtypes.&#10;This hypothesis is supported by recent investigations showing that APH1 variants can modulate AŒ≤ profiles.&#10;When compared to APH1aS or L, overexpression of APH1b in MEF knockout for all APH1 genes led to increased production of longer AŒ≤ species [24].&#10;With this regard, it is important to note that all four mouse variants of APH1 are expressed in the MEF cell line used in previous studies [23] and employed here (cf. Figure S3).&#10;Since the phenotype of PS1 mutations have mainly been assessed in vivo or in cell-based systems, we investigated the effects of FAD-linked PS1 mutants on the processing of APP-CTFs in cell-free systems, by using semi-purified and purified enzymatic complexes isolated from MEF PS1/PS2 double knockout cells stably overexpressing differentially tagged human Œ≥-secretase components.&#10;Under these conditions, the biochemical and functional properties of Œ≥-secretase complexes bearing either FAD-linked PS1 mutants (L166P, ŒîE9, and P436Q), dominant-negative forms of PS1 or wild-type PS1 were characterized.&#10;The activity of Œ≥-secretase with PS1-WT was similar to that reported for Œ≥-secretase purified from our CHO cells overexpressing NCT-V5, APH1aL, Flag-PEN2 and PS1-WT [26], [27], that resulted in AŒ≤1‚Äì42/AŒ≤1‚Äì40 ratios between 0.1 and 0.3.&#10;In contrast, we found a major loss in the activity of Œ≥-secretase complexes containing either the dominant-negative PS1 variants or the FAD-linked PS1 mutants.&#10;Although a total loss of activity was expected for the dominant negative forms of Œ≥-secretase [5], [6], [32], the drastic loss of activity seen here with the FAD-linked PS1 mutants was unexpected.&#10;Indeed, the PS1-L166P variant has previously been reported to increase AŒ≤1‚Äì42 levels both in vivo [46] and in vitro [20], in the presence of endogenous PS1, PS2 and APH1 components.&#10;In contrast, Bentahir and colleagues found that PS1-L166P decreased both AŒ≤1‚Äì40 and AŒ≤1‚Äì42 production in a PS knockout background.&#10;These results are consistent with our in vitro data, although the reduction in AŒ≤1‚Äì42 and AŒ≤1‚Äì40 production was more pronounced in our system.&#10;However, they differ from our cell-based data in which we observed an increase in AŒ≤1‚Äì42 associated with a decrease in AŒ≤1‚Äì40.&#10;Taken together, these data suggest that the overexpression of the other human components of Œ≥-secretase can influence the phenotype of FAD-linked mutations.&#10;Another possible explanation for these discrepancies comes from the use, in previously described cellular systems, of APP carrying the Swedish mutation (K670M/N671L) [20], [23], [46].&#10;Initially, this APP variant was shown to enhance the production of all AŒ≤ species by favouring its Œ≤-secretase cleavage [47], [48].&#10;However, Munter and colleagues recently demonstrated that the APP Swedish mutation can also affect the specificity of the Œ≥-secretase cleavage [49].&#10;In particular, these authors showed that over-expression of APP Swedish in a neuronal cell line led to a 4-fold increase in secreted AŒ≤42, associated with only a 2-fold increase of total AŒ≤, compared with the wild-type APP.&#10;Therefore, one cannot exclude the possibility of differential interactions between PS1-WT or PS1 variants and different APP variants, as suggested earlier [50].&#10;As far as the PS1-ŒîE9 mutant is concerned, previous cell-based studies have reported a decrease in AŒ≤40 levels associated with an increase in AŒ≤42 levels [51], [52], or no changes in AŒ≤40 levels despite increased AŒ≤42 levels [53], or a decrease in both AŒ≤ species [23].&#10;In the present study, AŒ≤1‚Äì40, AŒ≤1‚Äì42, as well as AICD levels generated from purified Œ≥-secretase complexes with PS1-ŒîE9 were close to the limit of detection, resulting in a loss of at least 95% of the Œ≥-secretase activity compared to wild-type PS1.&#10;Similarly, we found a near to complete loss of Œ≥-secretase activity for complexes with the aggressive PS1-P436Q mutant (mean onset: 28.3 years) [54].&#10;Consistent with a recent study [35], and in contrast to PS1-L166P, the maturation of the full-length PS1-P436Q protein into PS1-NTF and PS1-CTF was impaired.&#10;Interestingly, the same study also reported that P436Q variant showed a decreased Œ≥-secretase activity and AŒ≤40 and AŒ≤42 secretion in PS1/PS2 double knockout cells (~75% or ~50% of the control for AŒ≤40 or AŒ≤42, respectively), but to a lesser extent than what we measured in this study (more than 97% for both AŒ≤ species).&#10;Overall, our data show that, under our experimental conditions, the FAD-linked PS1 mutants cause a drastic loss of activity (at least 90%) in the highly purified and homogeneous as well as semi-purified Œ≥-secretase complexes.&#10;This loss-of-function is asymmetrical as AŒ≤1‚Äì42 levels were relatively less affected than AŒ≤1‚Äì40 levels.&#10;Interestingly, the ratio between the two AŒ≤ species was similar for the variants tested here (~1), suggesting a common modulatory mechanism.&#10;Our findings further support a model in which the subtype of Œ≥-secretase containing APH1aL and FAD-linked PS1 mutants generates a higher AŒ≤42/AŒ≤40 ratio compared to PS1-WT, as previously observed in vivo [15], [38].&#10;Taken together, the overall reduction in AŒ≤ levels strongly suggest that other regulatory mechanisms or cellular components may exist and account for the strong amyloid pathology observed in AD patients carrying these FAD-linked PSEN1 mutations.&#10;In agreement with this hypothesis, we report that the phenotype of FAD-linked PSEN1 mutations is different whether we consider the cell-based or the cell-free conditions.&#10;Indeed, even if AŒ≤42/AŒ≤40 ratios were globally increased in both experimental conditions, AŒ≤ production was strikingly different.&#10;One possible explanation would be that specific subtypes of Œ≥-secretase complexes are less affected than others by PSEN1 mutations.&#10;For instance, it remains unknown whether Œ≥-secretase complexes carrying APH1b or APH1aS are similarly affected by PSEN1 mutations.&#10;In support to that regard, Winkler and colleagues recently purified human Œ≥-secretase with PS1-L166P and observed that such complexes, containing both APH1a and AHP1b, led to increased AŒ≤1‚Äì42 production associated with decreased AŒ≤1‚Äì40 production, as compared to the PS1-WT complexes.&#10;Another possible explanation would be that purified Œ≥-secretase complexes lack binding partners modulating the processing of APP-based substrates, due to purification conditions affecting physical interactions of proteins.&#10;These include TMP21 or the recently reported Œ≥-secretase activating protein (GSAP) [12], [13].&#10;Further biochemical analyses are needed to test this hypothesis.&#10;The loss of activity in Œ≥-secretase containing PS1 variants also leads to decreased generation of AICD.&#10;As AICD is involved in the transcriptional regulation of several genes, including the neprilysin [55], and the lipoprotein receptor, LRP1 [11], it is likely that mutations in PSEN1 impair the regulation of these genes in vivo.&#10;For instance, it is possible that unknown genes transcriptionally regulated in vivo by the AICD might influence AŒ≤ metabolism in return.&#10;In support to these views, Veeraraghavalu and colleagues recently demonstrated that Notch signalling was impaired in transgenic mice overexpressing PS1 mutants, albeit in the presence of endogenous PS1-WT and all APH1 isoforms [56].&#10;They found decreased self-renewal and differentiation of neuronal precursor cells in the subventricular zone, suggesting that the loss-of-function phenotype of PSEN1 mutations can also be observed in heterogeneous conditions.&#10;These results are reminiscent of the previous report from Saura and colleagues showing that conditional inactivation of both presenilins in vivo induces age-dependent neurodegeneration associated with memory impairment [57].&#10;Altogether, the above-described data suggest that alternative pathways of neurodegeneration related to loss of Œ≥-secretase functions are possible and relevant to AD.&#10;They further support the concept that modulating rather than inhibiting Œ≥-secretase activity would be a more appropriate therapeutic strategy for AD [58].&#10;Supporting this view, the Œ≥-secretase inhibitor Semagacestat tested in phase III clinical trials not only failed to slow cognitive decline in patients with mild-to-moderate AD, but actually made it worse [59].&#10;Collectively, our findings support a model in which FAD-linked mutations in PSEN1 likely induce AŒ≤ pathology by perturbing the relative ratio between AŒ≤ species and by impairing developmental and cellular signalling pathways controlled by Œ≥-secretase substrates.&#10;This deleterious dual effect might explain why FAD-linked PSEN1 mutations cause early onset Alzheimer's disease.&#10;Since it has been established that AŒ≤ and AICD are generated following the processing by Œ≥-secretase at two distinct gamma- and epsilon-cleavage sites in APP [60], further investigation is now required to better understand whether and how FAD mutations in PS1 differentially affect the epsilon versus gamma-cleavage sites in APP, as well as in other known Œ≥-secretase substrates.&#10;Materials and Methods Top DNA Constructs and mutagenesisNCT-V5, Flag-PEN2, APH1aL-HA, wild-type PS1 human cDNAs (PS1-WT) were obtained from D. Selkoe (Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA).&#10;PS1 ŒîE9 cDNA was obtained from C. Saura (Universitat Aut√≤noma de Barcelona, Spain).&#10;PS1 D257A and PS1 D385A cDNAs were obtained from M. Wolfe (Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA).&#10;The sequences corresponding to enzyme restriction sites are given in small letters.&#10;The PCR fragments were next digested with BamHI/HindIII and HindIII/XhoI respectively, and were subcloned into pcDNA3.&#10;PS1 D257A/D385A (DDAA) was obtained by subcloning the DraI/XhoI digested fragment of PS1 D385A into pcDNA3.1-PS1 D257A.&#10;All constructs were next subcloned into the self-inactivated vector pSIN-PGK-WHV cassette (a kind gift from R. Zufferey, Brain Mind Institute, EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland).&#10;Inserts for plasmids pET21-C100-Flag, and pET21-C100-His were generated by PCR as previously described [27].&#10;Plasmids pMD2G and psPAX2 were obtained from D. Trono (Global Health Institute, EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland).&#10;Lentivector productionReplication-defective lentiviral particles were produced by a three-plasmid transient transfection of cells from the human embryonic kidney HEK 293T cell line [61].&#10;Briefly, cells were incubated in 10 cm dishes until they reached 70% confluence and were transiently co-transfected by the calcium phosphate method, with 5 ¬µg of envelope plasmid (pMD2G), 15 ¬µg of packaging plasmid (psPAX2), and 20 ¬µg of vector plasmids (pSIN-PGK-WHV).&#10;Cells were incubated overnight with DNA-calcium precipitates, washed twice with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Invitrogen) and incubated with 7 mL of DMEM.&#10;After 24 h, the conditioned medium was harvested and cells were incubated a second time with 7 mL of DMEM for 24 h. Media were then pooled, passed through 0.45 ¬µm filter, and stored at ‚àí80¬∞C as 2 mL aliquots until use.&#10;A p24 ELISA (Zeptometrix corporation) was performed on each batch of media in order to evaluate the number of viral particles generated.&#10;Generation of stable cell lines through multiple gene transductionsMouse Embryonic Fibroblasts (MEFs, obtained from B. De Strooper, Flanders University Institute of Biotechnology, Belgium) defective in PSEN1 and PSEN2 [30], [31] were cultivated in 10 cm dishes in DMEM, supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS) and penicillin/streptomycin (P/S) (Invitrogen).&#10;A first set of stable cell lines was generated by co-transducing NCT-V5, APH1aL-HA, and Flag-PEN2 containing lentiviral vectors (LV) repeatedly for two weeks at each passage (1/20).&#10;Ten clones were isolated by the limiting dilution method and were further screened for NCT-V5, Flag-PEN2 and APH1aL-HA expression by immunodetection.&#10;The clone that showed the highest expression of the three proteins (designated Œ≥ - PS1/2) was used as the parental cell line to generate the stable cell lines expressing different PS1 variants, by the same method and by using lentiviral vectors carrying human PS1-WT, PS1-L166P, PS1-ŒîE9, PS1-P436Q, PS1-D257A, PS1-D385A, and PS1-DDAA.&#10;For each PS1 variant, five clones were selected for a full characterization and two of them were further used for Œ≥-secretase purification.&#10;For SPA4CT overexpression experiments, 500,000 cells of each clone were exposed to the same arbitrary dose of lentiviral vectors carrying human SPA4CT-Flag in 2 mL of DMEM, 1% FBS, P/S and were plated in 6-wells plates for 72 h. The medium was next replaced by fresh DMEM, 2% FBS, P/S for 24 h. Finally, cell culture medium was harvested, supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche), centrifuged for 3 min at 1,000√ó rpm and frozen at ‚àí80¬∞C until further processing.&#10;Cells were washed in PBS and submitted to protein extraction.&#10;Protein extractionTotal protein extracts were prepared in 1% NP40 - HEPES buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM CaCl2), supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche), and were clarified by centrifugation for 1 h at 16,000√ó g, 4¬∞C. Cell membranes were obtained as described below and solubilised in 1% CHAPSO - HEPES buffer and centrifuged at 16,000√ó g for 1 h. Supernatants corresponding to the microsomal protein extracts were harvested and stored at ‚àí80¬∞C. Protein content of the extracts was estimated by the BCA protein assay reagent kit (Pierce).&#10;Multi-step purification of human Œ≥-secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 variants1) Cell membrane preparation.&#10;MEF PS1/PS2 DKO cells (1.0√ó109 cells) expressing NCT-V5, Flag-PEN2, APH1aL-HA and different forms of PS1: wild type (WT), or with FAD-linked variants or lacking the critical aspartate residues, were collected from 15 cm dishes and fully resuspended in 40 mL of MES buffer (50 mM MES, pH 6.0, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM CaCl2), supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche).&#10;Next, cells were passed four times through a high-pressure homogenizer (Emulsiflex-C5, Avestin Inc, ON Canada) at a pressure greater than 1,000 psi.&#10;Nuclei and unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation at 3,000√ó g for 20 min at 4¬∞C in a Beckman Coulter Allegra X-15R centrifuge.&#10;The supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 100,000√ó g for 1 h at 4¬∞C in a SW32Ti rotor using a Beckman Coulter Optima L-80 ultracentrifuge to recover the membrane preparation in the pellet.&#10;The membrane pellet was fully resuspended in 1.6 mL of ice cold sodium bicarbonate buffer (0.1 M NaHCO3, pH 11.3) by pipetting up and down at least 30 times, and incubated at 4¬∞C for 20 min.&#10;The washed membranes were then centrifuged at 100,000√ó g for 1 h at 4¬∞C and stored at ‚àí80¬∞C until use.&#10;3) Solubilisation of Œ≥-secretase complexes.&#10;The bicarbonate-washed membranes were fully resuspended in 1.7 mL of 1% CHAPSO - HEPES buffer by pipetting up and down at least 30 times.&#10;The membranes were then incubated at 4¬∞C for 1 h. To pellet the insoluble material, the solution was centrifuged at 16,000√ó g at 4¬∞C for 1 h, the pellet was discarded, and the supernatant saved.&#10;This lysate is defined as ‚Äúsolubilised Œ≥-secretase preparation‚Äù.&#10;Next, these freshly prepared solubilised preparations were used for affinity purification of Œ≥-secretase complexes as described below.&#10;4) Anti-Flag M2 affinity purification.&#10;The solubilised Œ≥-secretase preparations were first diluted 1:2 with HEPES buffer, and further diluted 1:6 with 0.1% digitonin - TBS buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl) (final detergent concentration: 0.08% CHAPSO, 0.08% digitonin) and incubated overnight at 4¬∞C with agitation after adding 200 ¬µL of anti-Flag M2 affinity resin beads (Sigma-Aldrich) that had been pre-equilibrated in 0.1% Digitonin - TBS buffer.&#10;The beads were washed 3 times in the same buffer, and the bound proteins were eluted over 4 h at 4¬∞C with 0.4 mL of this buffer containing 200 ¬µg/mL of Flag peptides (Sigma-Aldrich).&#10;This elution step was repeated once for 1 h at 4¬∞C and the eluted fractions were pooled and designated ‚ÄúM2 pooled 800 ¬µL fractions‚Äù.&#10;5) Anti-V5 affinity purification.&#10;The M2 pooled fractions (volume made up to 1 mL with 0.1% Digitonin - TBS buffer) were next incubated overnight at 4¬∞C under agitation with 200 ¬µL of anti-V5 affinity resin beads (Sigma-Aldrich), pre-equilibrated in 0.1% digitonin-TBS buffer.&#10;The beads were washed 3 times in the same buffer, and the bound proteins were eluted for 1 h at 4¬∞C with 0.4 mL of this buffer containing 500 ¬µg/mL of V5 peptides (Sigma-Aldrich).&#10;This elution step was repeated 4 times, and the eluted fractions were pooled and designated ‚ÄúV5 pooled 1.6 mL fractions‚Äù.&#10;As a final purification step, the V5 pooled fractions (volume made up to 1.8 mL with 0.1% digitonin - TBS buffer) were next incubated overnight at 4¬∞C under agitation with 200 ¬µL of anti-HA affinity resin beads (Sigma-Aldrich), pre-equilibrated in 0.1% digitonin - TBS buffer.&#10;The beads were washed 3 times in the same buffer, and the bound proteins were eluted overnight at 4¬∞C with 0.2 mL of this buffer containing 200 ¬µg/mL of HA peptides (Sigma-Aldrich).&#10;This elution step was repeated once, for 1 h at 4¬∞C, and the two eluted fractions were kept separately, designated ‚ÄúHA fraction E1‚Äù and ‚ÄúHA fraction E2‚Äù.&#10;Co-immunoprecipitationCo-IPs were performed on microsomal protein extracts.&#10;Briefly, 100 ¬µg of proteins were diluted in a final volume of 1 mL of 1% CHAPSO - HEPES extraction buffer containing protease inhibitors (Roche), and 50 ¬µL of pre-equilibrated anti-Flag or anti-HA affinity beads (Sigma-Aldrich) were added.&#10;Samples were next incubated overnight at 4¬∞C on a rotator wheel and were washed three times in 0.2% CHAPSO - HEPES buffer.&#10;Finally, beads were resuspended in 50 ¬µL of 0.2% CHAPSO - HEPES buffer and were used for in vitro Œ≥-secretase assays.&#10;In vitro Œ≥-secretase activity assaysIn vitro Œ≥-secretase activity assays were performed as previously described [27].&#10;Œ≥-Secretase APP-based substrates were expressed in E. coli transfected with plasmids pET21-C100-Flag or pET21-C100-His as a fusion protein consisting of a Met for translation initiation, and either the Flag tag sequence (C100-Flag) or the His tag sequence (C100-His), and were affinity purified using an anti-Flag resin (M2, Sigma-Aldrich) or an Ni-NTA agarose resin (Invitrogen), respectively.&#10;Œ≥-Secretase activity was quantified by measuring the amount of AICD and AŒ≤ generated during the reaction, by immunoblot or sandwich ELISA respectively, as described below.SDS-PAGE, Native PAGE, Western blotting and antibodiesTotal or microsomal protein extracts were resolved by electrophoresis on NuPAGE¬Æ Novex¬Æ 4‚Äì12% Bis-Tris Gels (Invitrogen) or on standard 12% acrylamide/bisacrylamide Tris Glycine gels for SDS-PAGE analysis.&#10;Purified Œ≥-secretase was resolved by electrophoresis on NativePAGE‚Ñ¢ Novex¬Æ Bis-Tris 4‚Äì16% Gels for Blue Native (BN)-PAGE analysis (Invitrogen).&#10;Silver staining was performed directly on gel according to manufacturer instructions (Biorad).&#10;For immunoblot analysis, gels were transferred to nitrocellulose or PVDF membranes (Whatman), and probed with the following antibodies: anti-Nicastrin NCT164 (BD Bioscience), anti-V5-tag for NCT-V5 (Covance), MAB1563 (Millipore) or ab10281 (Abcam) for PS1 NTF, MAB5232 for PS1 CTF (Millipore), 3F10 for APH1aL-HA (Roche), anti-Flag M2 for Flag-PEN-2 or C100-Flag (Sigma-Aldrich), A8717 for APP CTF (Sigma-Aldrich), and A2066 for Œ≤-actin (Sigma-Aldrich).&#10;Anti-mouse/rabbit/rat IgG conjugated to Alexa 680 were purchased from Invitrogen.&#10;The Odyssey infrared imaging system (LICOR) was used to detect the fluorescent signal.&#10;Quantification of AŒ≤ peptidesAŒ≤ peptides from the Œ≥-secretase assays described above were quantified by sandwich ELISA according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer.&#10;Supporting Information Top Figure S1.&#10;Characterization of stable cell lines overexpressing human FAD-linked PS1 variants in MEF PS1/2‚àí/‚àí.&#10;Presenilin double-knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts were stably transduced with lentiviral vectors carrying genes encoding hPS1 variants harbouring FAD-linked mutations or mutations in the catalytic aspartate residue(s), or PS1-WT, and cloned.&#10;Two clones per PS1 variant were selected for characterization.&#10;(A) Whole cell protein extracts of the different cell lines were prepared in 1% NP40-HEPES buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE on 12% Tris-Glycine gels and analysed by immunostaining with various antibodies to detect the endogenous Œ≥-secretase core components: NCT (NCT164), hPS1 (NTF, MAB1563), and PEN2 (UD1), and with an antibody for APP (A8717).&#10;Œ≤-Actin was used as a loading control.&#10;Each lane represents one selected clone.&#10;(B) Œ≥-Secretase activity assays were performed with microsomal extracts prepared in 1% CHAPSO-HEPES buffer.&#10;Equal protein levels from the different extracts were diluted to 0.25% CHAPSO-HEPES buffer and incubated for 4 h at 37¬∞C with lipids and 1 ¬µM of recombinant human APP-based substrate (C100-Flag).&#10;Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunostained with anti-Flag (M2) or anti-PS1 (MAB1563).&#10;PS1 immunostaining was used to assess the amount of input material.&#10;* Indicates a non-specific band, which was not detected in microsomal protein extracts of the same cell lines using the same antibody (MAB1563) (B).&#10;APP-CTF profiles in WT MEF, MEF PS1/2‚àí/‚àí and Œ≥ -

It is located in the head, usually close to the primary sensory organs for such senses as vision, hearing, balance, taste, and smell. The brain of a vertebrate is the most complex organ of its body. In a typical human the cerebral cortex (the largest part) is estimated to contain 15–33 billion neurons, each connected by synapses to several thousand other neurons. These neurons communicate with one another by means of long protoplasmic fibers called axons, which carry trains of signal pulses called action potentials to distant parts of the brain or body targeting specific recipient cells. Physiologically, the function of the brain is to exert centralized control over the other organs of the body. The brain acts on the rest of the body both by generating patterns of muscle activity and by driving secretion of chemicals called hormones. This centralized control allows rapid and coordinated responses to changes in the environment. Some basic types of responsiveness such as reflexes can be mediated by the spinal cord or peripheral ganglia, but sophisticated purposeful control of behavior based on complex sensory input requires the information-integrating capabilities of a centralized brain. From a philosophical point of view, what makes the brain special in comparison to other organs is that it forms the physical structure that generates the mind. As Hippocrates put it: &quot;Men ought to know that from nothing else but the brain come joys, delights, laughter and sports, and sorrows, griefs, despondency, and lamentations. &quot; Through much of history, the mind was thought to be separate from the brain. Even for present-day neuroscience, the mechanisms by which brain activity gives rise to consciousness and thought remain very challenging to understand: despite rapid scientific progress, much about how the brain works remains a mystery. The operations of individual brain cells are now understood in considerable detail, but the way they cooperate in ensembles of millions has been very difficult to decipher. The most promising approaches treat the brain as a biological computer, very different in mechanism from electronic computers, but similar in the sense that it acquires information from the surrounding world, stores it, and processes it in a variety of ways. This article compares the properties of brains across the entire range of animal species, with the greatest attention to vertebrates.

Molecules are distinguished from ions by their lack of electrical charge. However, in quantum physics, organic chemistry, and biochemistry, the term molecule is often used less strictly, also being applied to polyatomic ions. In the kinetic theory of gases, the term molecule is often used for any gaseous particle regardless of its composition. According to this definition, noble gas atoms are considered molecules despite being composed of a single non-bonded atom. A molecule may consist of atoms of a single chemical element, as with oxygen (O2), or of different elements, as with water (H2O). Atoms and complexes connected by non-covalent bonds such as hydrogen bonds or ionic bonds are generally not considered single molecules. Molecules as components of matter are common in organic substances (and therefore biochemistry). They also make up most of the oceans and atmosphere. However, the majority of familiar solid substances on Earth, including most of the minerals that make up the crust, mantle, and core of the Earth, contain many chemical bonds, but are not made of identifiable molecules. Also, no typical molecule can be defined for ionic crystals and covalent crystals, although these are often composed of repeating unit cells that extend either in a plane (such as in graphene) or three-dimensionally. The theme of repeated unit-cellular-structure also holds for most condensed phases with metallic bonding, which means that solid metals are also not made of molecules. In glasses (solids that exist in a vitreous disordered state), atoms may also be held together by chemical bonds without presence of any definable molecule, but also without any of the regularity of repeating units that characterises crystals.@en"><resourceType>Freebase:/chemistry/chemical_compound</resourceType><resourceType>Freebase:/chemistry</resourceType><resourceType>DBpedia:TopicalConcept</resourceType></type:DbpediaAnnotation><type:DbpediaAnnotation xmi:id="8191" sofa="12" begin="658" end="662" componentId="System-dbpedia-spotlight" Uri="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gene" similarityScore="0.06906847655773163" abstract="For a non-technical introduction to the topic, see Introduction to genetics.

A chemical signal occurs via a synapse, a specialized connection with other cells. Neurons connect to each other to form neural networks. Neurons are the core components of the nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral ganglia. A number of specialized types of neurons exist: sensory neurons respond to touch, sound, light and numerous other stimuli affecting cells of the sensory organs that then send signals to the spinal cord and brain. Motor neurons receive signals from the brain and spinal cord, cause muscle contractions, and affect glands. Interneurons connect neurons to other neurons within the same region of the brain or spinal cord. A typical neuron possesses a cell body (often called the soma), dendrites, and an axon. Dendrites are thin structures that arise from the cell body, often extending for hundreds of micrometres and branching multiple times, giving rise to a complex &quot;dendritic tree&quot;. An axon is a special cellular extension that arises from the cell body at a site called the axon hillock and travels for a distance, as far as 1 meter in humans or even more in other species. The cell body of a neuron frequently gives rise to multiple dendrites, but never to more than one axon, although the axon may branch hundreds of times before it terminates. At the majority of synapses, signals are sent from the axon of one neuron to a dendrite of another. There are, however, many exceptions to these rules: neurons that lack dendrites, neurons that have no axon, synapses that connect an axon to another axon or a dendrite to another dendrite, etc. All neurons are electrically excitable, maintaining voltage gradients across their membranes by means of metabolically driven ion pumps, which combine with ion channels embedded in the membrane to generate intracellular-versus-extracellular concentration differences of ions such as sodium, potassium, chloride, and calcium. Changes in the cross-membrane voltage can alter the function of voltage-dependent ion channels. If the voltage changes by a large enough amount, an all-or-none electrochemical pulse called an action potential is generated, which travels rapidly along the cell's axon, and activates synaptic connections with other cells when it arrives. Neurons do not undergo cell division. In most cases, neurons are generated by special types of stem cells. Astrocytes, a type of glial cell, have also been observed to turn into neurons by virtue of the stem cell characteristic pluripotency. In humans, neurogenesis largely ceases during adulthood—but in two brain areas, the hippocampus and olfactory bulb, there is strong evidence for generation of substantial numbers of new neurons.@en"><resourceType>Freebase:/award/award_winning_work</resourceType><resourceType>Freebase:/award</resourceType><resourceType>Freebase:/medicine/anatomical_structure</resourceType><resourceType>Freebase:/medicine</resourceType></type:DbpediaAnnotation><type:DbpediaAnnotation xmi:id="8289" sofa="12" begin="3756" end="3761" componentId="System-dbpedia-spotlight" Uri="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gene" similarityScore="0.06906847655773163" abstract="For a non-technical introduction to the topic, see Introduction to genetics.

They are highly selective catalysts, greatly accelerating both the rate and specificity of metabolic reactions, from the digestion of food to the synthesis of DNA. Most enzymes are proteins, although some catalytic RNA molecules have been identified. Enzymes adopt a specific three-dimensional structure, and may employ organic (e.g. biotin) and inorganic (e.g. magnesium ion) cofactors to assist in catalysis. In enzymatic reactions, the molecules at the beginning of the process, called substrates, are converted into different molecules, called products. Almost all chemical reactions in a biological cell need enzymes in order to occur at rates sufficient for life. Since enzymes are selective for their substrates and speed up only a few reactions from among many possibilities, the set of enzymes made in a cell determines which metabolic pathways occur in that cell. Like all catalysts, enzymes work by lowering the activation energy (Ea) for a reaction, thus dramatically increasing the rate of the reaction. As a result, products are formed faster and reactions reach their equilibrium state more rapidly. Most enzyme reaction rates are millions of times faster than those of comparable un-catalyzed reactions. As with all catalysts, enzymes are not consumed by the reactions they catalyze, nor do they alter the equilibrium of these reactions. However, enzymes do differ from most other catalysts in that they are highly specific for their substrates. Enzymes are known to catalyze about 4,000 biochemical reactions. A few RNA molecules called ribozymes also catalyze reactions, with an important example being some parts of the ribosome. Synthetic molecules called artificial enzymes also display enzyme-like catalysis. Enzyme activity can be affected by other molecules. Inhibitors are molecules that decrease enzyme activity; activators are molecules that increase activity. Many drugs and poisons are enzyme inhibitors. Activity is also affected by temperature, pressure, chemical environment, and the concentration of substrate. Some enzymes are used commercially, for example, in the synthesis of antibiotics. In addition, some household products use enzymes to speed up biochemical reactions (e.g. , enzymes in biological washing powders break down protein or fat stains on clothes; enzymes in meat tenderizers break down proteins into smaller molecules, making the meat easier to chew).@en"><resourceType>Freebase:/chemistry/chemical_classification</resourceType><resourceType>Freebase:/chemistry</resourceType><resourceType>DBpedia:TopicalConcept</resourceType></type:DbpediaAnnotation><type:DbpediaAnnotation xmi:id="8349" sofa="12" begin="4885" end="4900" componentId="System-dbpedia-spotlight" Uri="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gene_expression" similarityScore="0.04803326725959778" abstract="Gene expression is the process by which information from a gene is used in the synthesis of a functional gene product.

The key elements of an amino acid are carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen, though other elements are found in the side-chains of certain amino acids. About 500 amino acids are known and can be classified in many ways. Structurally they can be classified according to the functional groups' locations as alpha- (α-), beta- (β-), gamma- (γ-) or delta- (δ-) amino acids; other categories relate to polarity, pH level, and side chain group type (aliphatic, acyclic, aromatic, containing hydroxyl or sulphur, et al.). In the form of proteins, amino acids comprise the second largest component of human muscles, cells and other tissues. Outside proteins, amino acids perform critical roles in processes such as neurotransmitter transport and biosynthesis. Amino acids having both the amine and carboxylic acid groups attached to the first (alpha-) carbon atom have particular importance in biochemistry. They are known as 2-, alpha-, or α-amino acids (generic formula H2NCHRCOOH in most cases where R is an organic substituent known as a &quot;side-chain&quot;); often the term &quot;amino acid&quot; is used to refer specifically to these. They include the 23 proteinogenic (&quot;protein-building&quot;) amino acids which combine into peptide chains (&quot;polypeptides&quot;) to form the building blocks of a vast array of proteins. These are all L-stereoisomers although a few D-amino acids (&quot;right-handed&quot;) occur in bacterial envelopes and some antibiotics. 20 of the 23 proteinogenic amino acids are encoded directly by triplet codons in the genetic code and are known as &quot;standard&quot; amino acids. The other three (&quot;non-standard&quot; or &quot;non-canonical&quot;) are pyrrolysine, selenocysteine (present in many noneukaryotes as well as most eukaryotes), and N-Formylmethionine. For example, 25 human proteins include selenocysteine (Sec) in their primary structure, and the structurally characterized enzymes (selenoenzymes) employ Sec as the catalytic moiety in their active sites. Pyrollysine and selenocysteine are encoded via variant codons; for example, selenocysteine is encoded by stop codon and SECIS element. Codon–tRNA combinations not found in nature can also be used to &quot;expand&quot; the genetic code and create novel proteins known as alloproteins incorporating non-proteinogenic amino acids. Many important proteinogenic and non-proteinogenic amino acids also play critical non-protein roles within the body. For example: in the human brain, glutamate and gamma-amino-butyric acid (&quot;GABA&quot;, non-standard gamma-amino acid) are respectively the main excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters; hydroxyproline is synthesised from proline; the standard amino acid glycine is used to synthesise porphyrins used in red blood cells; and the non-standard carnitine is used in lipid transport. 9 of the 20 standard amino acids are called &quot;essential&quot; for humans because they cannot be created from other compounds by the human body, and so must be taken in as food. Others may be conditionally essential for certain ages or medical conditions. Essential amino acids may also differ between species. Because of their biological significance, amino acids are important in nutrition and are commonly used in nutritional supplements, fertilizers, and food technology. Industrial uses include the production of drugs, biodegradable plastics and chiral catalysts.@en"><resourceType>Freebase:/chemistry/chemical_classification</resourceType><resourceType>Freebase:/chemistry</resourceType></type:DbpediaAnnotation><type:DbpediaAnnotation xmi:id="8400" sofa="12" begin="5577" end="5582" componentId="System-dbpedia-spotlight" Uri="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brain" similarityScore="0.05020182952284813" abstract="The brain is the center of the nervous system in all vertebrate and most invertebrate animals—only a few invertebrates such as sponges, jellyfish, adult sea squirts and starfish do not have one, even if diffuse neural tissue is present. It is located in the head, usually close to the primary sensory organs for such senses as vision, hearing, balance, taste, and smell. The brain of a vertebrate is the most complex organ of its body. In a typical human the cerebral cortex (the largest part) is estimated to contain 15–33 billion neurons, each connected by synapses to several thousand other neurons. These neurons communicate with one another by means of long protoplasmic fibers called axons, which carry trains of signal pulses called action potentials to distant parts of the brain or body targeting specific recipient cells. Physiologically, the function of the brain is to exert centralized control over the other organs of the body. The brain acts on the rest of the body both by generating patterns of muscle activity and by driving secretion of chemicals called hormones. This centralized control allows rapid and coordinated responses to changes in the environment. Some basic types of responsiveness such as reflexes can be mediated by the spinal cord or peripheral ganglia, but sophisticated purposeful control of behavior based on complex sensory input requires the information-integrating capabilities of a centralized brain. From a philosophical point of view, what makes the brain special in comparison to other organs is that it forms the physical structure that generates the mind. As Hippocrates put it: &quot;Men ought to know that from nothing else but the brain come joys, delights, laughter and sports, and sorrows, griefs, despondency, and lamentations. &quot; Through much of history, the mind was thought to be separate from the brain. Even for present-day neuroscience, the mechanisms by which brain activity gives rise to consciousness and thought remain very challenging to understand: despite rapid scientific progress, much about how the brain works remains a mystery. The operations of individual brain cells are now understood in considerable detail, but the way they cooperate in ensembles of millions has been very difficult to decipher. The most promising approaches treat the brain as a biological computer, very different in mechanism from electronic computers, but similar in the sense that it acquires information from the surrounding world, stores it, and processes it in a variety of ways.

Cholesterol is the principal sterol synthesized by animals; in vertebrates it is formed predominantly in the liver. It is almost completely absent among prokaryotes (i.e. , bacteria).

Proteins perform a vast array of functions within living organisms, including catalyzing metabolic reactions, replicating DNA, responding to stimuli, and transporting molecules from one location to another. Proteins differ from one another primarily in their sequence of amino acids, which is dictated by the nucleotide sequence of their genes, and which usually results in folding of the protein into a specific three-dimensional structure that determines its activity. A polypeptide is a single linear polymer chain of amino acids bonded together by peptide bonds between the carboxyl and amino groups of adjacent amino acid residues. The sequence of amino acids in a protein is defined by the sequence of a gene, which is encoded in the genetic code.

The production of antibodies is the main function of the humoral immune system. Antibodies are secreted by a type of white blood cell called a plasma cell. Antibodies can occur in two physical forms, a soluble form that is secreted from the cell, and a membrane-bound form that is attached to the surface of a B cell and is referred to as the B cell receptor (BCR). The BCR is only found on the surface of B cells and facilitates the activation of these cells and their subsequent differentiation into either antibody factories called plasma cells, or memory B cells that will survive in the body and remember that same antigen so the B cells can respond faster upon future exposure. In most cases, interaction of the B cell with a T helper cell is necessary to produce full activation of the B cell and, therefore, antibody generation following antigen binding. Soluble antibodies are released into the blood and tissue fluids, as well as many secretions to continue to survey for invading microorganisms. Antibodies are glycoproteins belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily; the terms antibody and immunoglobulin are often used interchangeably. Antibodies are typically made of basic structural units—each with two large heavy chains and two small light chains. There are several different types of antibody heavy chains, and several different kinds of antibodies, which are grouped into different isotypes based on which heavy chain they possess. Five different antibody isotypes are known in mammals, which perform different roles, and help direct the appropriate immune response for each different type of foreign object they encounter. Though the general structure of all antibodies is very similar, a small region at the tip of the protein is extremely variable, allowing millions of antibodies with slightly different tip structures, or antigen binding sites, to exist. This region is known as the hypervariable region. Each of these variants can bind to a different antigen. This enormous diversity of antibodies allows the immune system to recognize an equally wide variety of antigens. The large and diverse population of antibodies is generated by random combinations of a set of gene segments that encode different antigen binding sites (or paratopes), followed by random mutations in this area of the antibody gene, which create further diversity. Antibody genes also re-organize in a process called class switching that changes the base of the heavy chain to another, creating a different isotype of the antibody that retains the antigen specific variable region. This allows a single antibody to be used by several different parts of the immune system.@en"><resourceType>Freebase:/book/book_subject</resourceType><resourceType>Freebase:/book</resourceType></type:DbpediaAnnotation><type:DbpediaAnnotation xmi:id="8827" sofa="12" begin="18441" end="18451" componentId="System-dbpedia-spotlight" Uri="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Amino_acid" similarityScore="0.05691830441355705" abstract="Amino acids are biologically important organic compounds made from amine (-NH2) and carboxylic acid (-COOH) functional groups, along with a side-chain specific to each amino acid. The key elements of an amino acid are carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen, though other elements are found in the side-chains of certain amino acids. About 500 amino acids are known and can be classified in many ways. Structurally they can be classified according to the functional groups' locations as alpha- (α-), beta- (β-), gamma- (γ-) or delta- (δ-) amino acids; other categories relate to polarity, pH level, and side chain group type (aliphatic, acyclic, aromatic, containing hydroxyl or sulphur, et al.). In the form of proteins, amino acids comprise the second largest component of human muscles, cells and other tissues. Outside proteins, amino acids perform critical roles in processes such as neurotransmitter transport and biosynthesis. Amino acids having both the amine and carboxylic acid groups attached to the first (alpha-) carbon atom have particular importance in biochemistry. They are known as 2-, alpha-, or α-amino acids (generic formula H2NCHRCOOH in most cases where R is an organic substituent known as a &quot;side-chain&quot;); often the term &quot;amino acid&quot; is used to refer specifically to these. They include the 23 proteinogenic (&quot;protein-building&quot;) amino acids which combine into peptide chains (&quot;polypeptides&quot;) to form the building blocks of a vast array of proteins. These are all L-stereoisomers although a few D-amino acids (&quot;right-handed&quot;) occur in bacterial envelopes and some antibiotics. 20 of the 23 proteinogenic amino acids are encoded directly by triplet codons in the genetic code and are known as &quot;standard&quot; amino acids. The other three (&quot;non-standard&quot; or &quot;non-canonical&quot;) are pyrrolysine, selenocysteine (present in many noneukaryotes as well as most eukaryotes), and N-Formylmethionine. For example, 25 human proteins include selenocysteine (Sec) in their primary structure, and the structurally characterized enzymes (selenoenzymes) employ Sec as the catalytic moiety in their active sites. Pyrollysine and selenocysteine are encoded via variant codons; for example, selenocysteine is encoded by stop codon and SECIS element. Codon–tRNA combinations not found in nature can also be used to &quot;expand&quot; the genetic code and create novel proteins known as alloproteins incorporating non-proteinogenic amino acids. Many important proteinogenic and non-proteinogenic amino acids also play critical non-protein roles within the body. For example: in the human brain, glutamate and gamma-amino-butyric acid (&quot;GABA&quot;, non-standard gamma-amino acid) are respectively the main excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters; hydroxyproline is synthesised from proline; the standard amino acid glycine is used to synthesise porphyrins used in red blood cells; and the non-standard carnitine is used in lipid transport. 9 of the 20 standard amino acids are called &quot;essential&quot; for humans because they cannot be created from other compounds by the human body, and so must be taken in as food. Others may be conditionally essential for certain ages or medical conditions. Essential amino acids may also differ between species. Because of their biological significance, amino acids are important in nutrition and are commonly used in nutritional supplements, fertilizers, and food technology. Industrial uses include the production of drugs, biodegradable plastics and chiral catalysts.@en"><resourceType>Freebase:/chemistry/chemical_classification</resourceType><resourceType>Freebase:/chemistry</resourceType></type:DbpediaAnnotation><type:DbpediaAnnotation xmi:id="8843" sofa="12" begin="18977" end="18982" componentId="System-dbpedia-spotlight" Uri="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cell_%28biology%29" similarityScore="0.13335959613323212"><resourceType>DBpedia:TopicalConcept</resourceType></type:DbpediaAnnotation><type:DbpediaAnnotation xmi:id="8856" sofa="12" begin="19335" end="19342" componentId="System-dbpedia-spotlight" Uri="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Protein" similarityScore="0.089495949447155" abstract="Proteins are large biological molecules consisting of one or more chains of amino acids.

The main biological functions of lipids include energy storage, signaling, and acting as structural components of cell membranes. Lipids have found applications in cosmetic and food industries as well as in nanotechnology. Lipids may be broadly defined as hydrophobic or amphiphilic small molecules; the amphiphilic nature of some lipids allows them to form structures such as vesicles, liposomes, or membranes in an aqueous environment. Biological lipids originate entirely or in part from two distinct types of biochemical subunits or &quot;building-blocks&quot;: ketoacyl and isoprene groups. Using this approach, lipids may be divided into eight categories: fatty acids, glycerolipids, glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids, saccharolipids, and polyketides (derived from condensation of ketoacyl subunits); and sterol lipids and prenol lipids (derived from condensation of isoprene subunits). Although the term lipid is sometimes used as a synonym for fats, fats are a subgroup of lipids called triglycerides. Lipids also encompass molecules such as fatty acids and their derivatives, as well as other sterol-containing metabolites such as cholesterol.

Five different antibody isotypes are known in mammals, which perform different roles, and help direct the appropriate immune response for each different type of foreign object they encounter. Though the general structure of all antibodies is very similar, a small region at the tip of the protein is extremely variable, allowing millions of antibodies with slightly different tip structures, or antigen binding sites, to exist. This region is known as the hypervariable region. Each of these variants can bind to a different antigen. This enormous diversity of antibodies allows the immune system to recognize an equally wide variety of antigens. The large and diverse population of antibodies is generated by random combinations of a set of gene segments that encode different antigen binding sites (or paratopes), followed by random mutations in this area of the antibody gene, which create further diversity. Antibody genes also re-organize in a process called class switching that changes the base of the heavy chain to another, creating a different isotype of the antibody that retains the antigen specific variable region. This allows a single antibody to be used by several different parts of the immune system.@en"><resourceType>Freebase:/book/book_subject</resourceType><resourceType>Freebase:/book</resourceType></type:DbpediaAnnotation><type:DbpediaAnnotation xmi:id="9091" sofa="12" begin="28861" end="28866" componentId="System-dbpedia-spotlight" Uri="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brain" similarityScore="0.05020182952284813" abstract="The brain is the center of the nervous system in all vertebrate and most invertebrate animals—only a few invertebrates such as sponges, jellyfish, adult sea squirts and starfish do not have one, even if diffuse neural tissue is present.

They are highly selective catalysts, greatly accelerating both the rate and specificity of metabolic reactions, from the digestion of food to the synthesis of DNA. Most enzymes are proteins, although some catalytic RNA molecules have been identified. Enzymes adopt a specific three-dimensional structure, and may employ organic (e.g. biotin) and inorganic (e.g. magnesium ion) cofactors to assist in catalysis. In enzymatic reactions, the molecules at the beginning of the process, called substrates, are converted into different molecules, called products. Almost all chemical reactions in a biological cell need enzymes in order to occur at rates sufficient for life. Since enzymes are selective for their substrates and speed up only a few reactions from among many possibilities, the set of enzymes made in a cell determines which metabolic pathways occur in that cell. Like all catalysts, enzymes work by lowering the activation energy (Ea) for a reaction, thus dramatically increasing the rate of the reaction. As a result, products are formed faster and reactions reach their equilibrium state more rapidly. Most enzyme reaction rates are millions of times faster than those of comparable un-catalyzed reactions. As with all catalysts, enzymes are not consumed by the reactions they catalyze, nor do they alter the equilibrium of these reactions. However, enzymes do differ from most other catalysts in that they are highly specific for their substrates. Enzymes are known to catalyze about 4,000 biochemical reactions. A few RNA molecules called ribozymes also catalyze reactions, with an important example being some parts of the ribosome. Synthetic molecules called artificial enzymes also display enzyme-like catalysis. Enzyme activity can be affected by other molecules. Inhibitors are molecules that decrease enzyme activity; activators are molecules that increase activity. Many drugs and poisons are enzyme inhibitors. Activity is also affected by temperature, pressure, chemical environment, and the concentration of substrate. Some enzymes are used commercially, for example, in the synthesis of antibiotics. In addition, some household products use enzymes to speed up biochemical reactions (e.g. , enzymes in biological washing powders break down protein or fat stains on clothes; enzymes in meat tenderizers break down proteins into smaller molecules, making the meat easier to chew).@en"><resourceType>Freebase:/chemistry/chemical_classification</resourceType><resourceType>Freebase:/chemistry</resourceType><resourceType>DBpedia:TopicalConcept</resourceType></type:DbpediaAnnotation><type:DbpediaAnnotation xmi:id="9276" sofa="12" begin="30865" end="30870" componentId="System-dbpedia-spotlight" Uri="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cell_%28biology%29" similarityScore="0.13335959613323212"><resourceType>DBpedia:TopicalConcept</resourceType></type:DbpediaAnnotation><type:DbpediaAnnotation xmi:id="9289" sofa="12" begin="31883" end="31891" componentId="System-dbpedia-spotlight" Uri="http://dbpedia.org/resource/In_vitro" similarityScore="0.0667799636721611" abstract="In vitro studies in experimental biology are those that are conducted using components of an organism that have been isolated from their usual biological surroundings in order to permit a more detailed or more convenient analysis than can be done with whole organisms.

These products are often proteins, but in non-protein coding genes such as ribosomal RNA (rRNA), transfer RNA (tRNA) or small nuclear RNA (snRNA) genes, the product is a functional RNA. The process of gene expression is used by all known life - eukaryotes, prokaryotes, possibly induced by viruses - to generate the macromolecular machinery for life. Several steps in the gene expression process may be modulated, including the transcription, RNA splicing, translation, and post-translational modification of a protein. Gene regulation gives the cell control over structure and function, and is the basis for cellular differentiation, morphogenesis and the versatility and adaptability of any organism. Gene regulation may also serve as a substrate for evolutionary change, since control of the timing, location, and amount of gene expression can have a profound effect on the functions (actions) of the gene in a cell or in a multicellular organism. In genetics, gene expression is the most fundamental level at which the genotype gives rise to the phenotype. The genetic code stored in DNA is &quot;interpreted&quot; by gene expression, and the properties of the expression give rise to the organism's phenotype.

A chemical signal occurs via a synapse, a specialized connection with other cells. Neurons connect to each other to form neural networks. Neurons are the core components of the nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral ganglia. A number of specialized types of neurons exist: sensory neurons respond to touch, sound, light and numerous other stimuli affecting cells of the sensory organs that then send signals to the spinal cord and brain. Motor neurons receive signals from the brain and spinal cord, cause muscle contractions, and affect glands. Interneurons connect neurons to other neurons within the same region of the brain or spinal cord. A typical neuron possesses a cell body (often called the soma), dendrites, and an axon. Dendrites are thin structures that arise from the cell body, often extending for hundreds of micrometres and branching multiple times, giving rise to a complex &quot;dendritic tree&quot;. An axon is a special cellular extension that arises from the cell body at a site called the axon hillock and travels for a distance, as far as 1 meter in humans or even more in other species. The cell body of a neuron frequently gives rise to multiple dendrites, but never to more than one axon, although the axon may branch hundreds of times before it terminates. At the majority of synapses, signals are sent from the axon of one neuron to a dendrite of another. There are, however, many exceptions to these rules: neurons that lack dendrites, neurons that have no axon, synapses that connect an axon to another axon or a dendrite to another dendrite, etc. All neurons are electrically excitable, maintaining voltage gradients across their membranes by means of metabolically driven ion pumps, which combine with ion channels embedded in the membrane to generate intracellular-versus-extracellular concentration differences of ions such as sodium, potassium, chloride, and calcium. Changes in the cross-membrane voltage can alter the function of voltage-dependent ion channels. If the voltage changes by a large enough amount, an all-or-none electrochemical pulse called an action potential is generated, which travels rapidly along the cell's axon, and activates synaptic connections with other cells when it arrives. Neurons do not undergo cell division. In most cases, neurons are generated by special types of stem cells. Astrocytes, a type of glial cell, have also been observed to turn into neurons by virtue of the stem cell characteristic pluripotency. In humans, neurogenesis largely ceases during adulthood—but in two brain areas, the hippocampus and olfactory bulb, there is strong evidence for generation of substantial numbers of new neurons.@en"><resourceType>Freebase:/award/award_winning_work</resourceType><resourceType>Freebase:/award</resourceType><resourceType>Freebase:/medicine/anatomical_structure</resourceType><resourceType>Freebase:/medicine</resourceType></type:DbpediaAnnotation><type:DbpediaAnnotation xmi:id="9363" sofa="12" begin="33442" end="33446" componentId="System-dbpedia-spotlight" Uri="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cell_%28biology%29" similarityScore="0.13335959613323212"><resourceType>DBpedia:TopicalConcept</resourceType></type:DbpediaAnnotation><type:DbpediaAnnotation xmi:id="9376" sofa="12" begin="34185" end="34192" componentId="System-dbpedia-spotlight" Uri="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Protein" similarityScore="0.089495949447155" abstract="Proteins are large biological molecules consisting of one or more chains of amino acids. Proteins perform a vast array of functions within living organisms, including catalyzing metabolic reactions, replicating DNA, responding to stimuli, and transporting molecules from one location to another. Proteins differ from one another primarily in their sequence of amino acids, which is dictated by the nucleotide sequence of their genes, and which usually results in folding of the protein into a specific three-dimensional structure that determines its activity. A polypeptide is a single linear polymer chain of amino acids bonded together by peptide bonds between the carboxyl and amino groups of adjacent amino acid residues. The sequence of amino acids in a protein is defined by the sequence of a gene, which is encoded in the genetic code. In general, the genetic code specifies 20 standard amino acids; however, in certain organisms the genetic code can include selenocysteine and—in certain archaea—pyrrolysine. Shortly after or even during synthesis, the residues in a protein are often chemically modified by posttranslational modification, which alters the physical and chemical properties, folding, stability, activity, and ultimately, the function of the proteins. Sometimes proteins have non-peptide groups attached, which can be called prosthetic groups or cofactors. Proteins can also work together to achieve a particular function, and they often associate to form stable protein complexes. Like other biological macromolecules such as polysaccharides and nucleic acids, proteins are essential parts of organisms and participate in virtually every process within cells. Many proteins are enzymes that catalyze biochemical reactions and are vital to metabolism. Proteins also have structural or mechanical functions, such as actin and myosin in muscle and the proteins in the cytoskeleton, which form a system of scaffolding that maintains cell shape. Other proteins are important in cell signaling, immune responses, cell adhesion, and the cell cycle. Proteins are also necessary in animals' diets, since animals cannot synthesize all the amino acids they need and must obtain essential amino acids from food.

A chemical signal occurs via a synapse, a specialized connection with other cells. Neurons connect to each other to form neural networks. Neurons are the core components of the nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral ganglia. A number of specialized types of neurons exist: sensory neurons respond to touch, sound, light and numerous other stimuli affecting cells of the sensory organs that then send signals to the spinal cord and brain. Motor neurons receive signals from the brain and spinal cord, cause muscle contractions, and affect glands. Interneurons connect neurons to other neurons within the same region of the brain or spinal cord. A typical neuron possesses a cell body (often called the soma), dendrites, and an axon. Dendrites are thin structures that arise from the cell body, often extending for hundreds of micrometres and branching multiple times, giving rise to a complex &quot;dendritic tree&quot;. An axon is a special cellular extension that arises from the cell body at a site called the axon hillock and travels for a distance, as far as 1 meter in humans or even more in other species. The cell body of a neuron frequently gives rise to multiple dendrites, but never to more than one axon, although the axon may branch hundreds of times before it terminates. At the majority of synapses, signals are sent from the axon of one neuron to a dendrite of another. There are, however, many exceptions to these rules: neurons that lack dendrites, neurons that have no axon, synapses that connect an axon to another axon or a dendrite to another dendrite, etc. All neurons are electrically excitable, maintaining voltage gradients across their membranes by means of metabolically driven ion pumps, which combine with ion channels embedded in the membrane to generate intracellular-versus-extracellular concentration differences of ions such as sodium, potassium, chloride, and calcium. Changes in the cross-membrane voltage can alter the function of voltage-dependent ion channels. If the voltage changes by a large enough amount, an all-or-none electrochemical pulse called an action potential is generated, which travels rapidly along the cell's axon, and activates synaptic connections with other cells when it arrives. Neurons do not undergo cell division. In most cases, neurons are generated by special types of stem cells. Astrocytes, a type of glial cell, have also been observed to turn into neurons by virtue of the stem cell characteristic pluripotency. In humans, neurogenesis largely ceases during adulthood—but in two brain areas, the hippocampus and olfactory bulb, there is strong evidence for generation of substantial numbers of new neurons.@en"><resourceType>Freebase:/award/award_winning_work</resourceType><resourceType>Freebase:/award</resourceType><resourceType>Freebase:/medicine/anatomical_structure</resourceType><resourceType>Freebase:/medicine</resourceType></type:DbpediaAnnotation><type:DbpediaAnnotation xmi:id="9560" sofa="12" begin="39223" end="39226" componentId="System-dbpedia-spotlight" Uri="http://dbpedia.org/resource/DNA" similarityScore="0.06963567435741425" abstract="Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a molecule that encodes the genetic instructions used in the development and functioning of all known living organisms and many viruses. Along with RNA and proteins, DNA is one of the three major macromolecules essential for all known forms of life. Genetic information is encoded as a sequence of nucleotides recorded using the letters G, A, T, and C. Most DNA molecules are double-stranded helices, consisting of two long polymers of simple units called nucleotides, molecules with backbones made of alternating sugars and phosphate groups (related to phosphoric acid), with the nucleobases (G, A, T, C) attached to the sugars. DNA is well-suited for biological information storage, since the DNA backbone is resistant to cleavage and the double-stranded structure provides the molecule with a built-in duplicate of the encoded information. These two strands run in opposite directions to each other and are therefore anti-parallel, one backbone being 3' (three prime) and the other 5' (five prime). This refers to the direction the 3rd and 5th carbon on the sugar molecule is facing. Attached to each sugar is one of four types of molecules called nucleobases (informally, bases). It is the sequence of these four nucleobases along the backbone that encodes information. This information is read using the genetic code, which specifies the sequence of the amino acids within proteins. The code is read by copying stretches of DNA into the related nucleic acid RNA in a process called transcription. Within cells, DNA is organized into long structures called chromosomes. During cell division these chromosomes are duplicated in the process of DNA replication, providing each cell its own complete set of chromosomes. Eukaryotic organisms store most of their DNA inside the cell nucleus and some of their DNA in organelles, such as mitochondria or chloroplasts. In contrast, prokaryotes store their DNA only in the cytoplasm. Within the chromosomes, chromatin proteins such as histones compact and organize DNA. These compact structures guide the interactions between DNA and other proteins, helping control which parts of the DNA are transcribed.@en"><resourceType>Freebase:/book/book_subject</resourceType><resourceType>Freebase:/book</resourceType><resourceType>Freebase:/award/award_winning_work</resourceType><resourceType>Freebase:/award</resourceType><resourceType>Freebase:/chemistry/chemical_compound</resourceType><resourceType>Freebase:/chemistry</resourceType><resourceType>DBpedia:TopicalConcept</resourceType></type:DbpediaAnnotation><type:DbpediaAnnotation xmi:id="9591" sofa="12" begin="40152" end="40158" componentId="System-dbpedia-spotlight" Uri="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Enzyme" similarityScore="0.07105185091495514" abstract="Enzymes are large biological molecules responsible for the thousands of chemical interconversions that sustain life. They are highly selective catalysts, greatly accelerating both the rate and specificity of metabolic reactions, from the digestion of food to the synthesis of DNA. Most enzymes are proteins, although some catalytic RNA molecules have been identified. Enzymes adopt a specific three-dimensional structure, and may employ organic (e.g. biotin) and inorganic (e.g. magnesium ion) cofactors to assist in catalysis. In enzymatic reactions, the molecules at the beginning of the process, called substrates, are converted into different molecules, called products. Almost all chemical reactions in a biological cell need enzymes in order to occur at rates sufficient for life. Since enzymes are selective for their substrates and speed up only a few reactions from among many possibilities, the set of enzymes made in a cell determines which metabolic pathways occur in that cell. Like all catalysts, enzymes work by lowering the activation energy (Ea) for a reaction, thus dramatically increasing the rate of the reaction. As a result, products are formed faster and reactions reach their equilibrium state more rapidly. Most enzyme reaction rates are millions of times faster than those of comparable un-catalyzed reactions. As with all catalysts, enzymes are not consumed by the reactions they catalyze, nor do they alter the equilibrium of these reactions. However, enzymes do differ from most other catalysts in that they are highly specific for their substrates. Enzymes are known to catalyze about 4,000 biochemical reactions. A few RNA molecules called ribozymes also catalyze reactions, with an important example being some parts of the ribosome. Synthetic molecules called artificial enzymes also display enzyme-like catalysis. Enzyme activity can be affected by other molecules. Inhibitors are molecules that decrease enzyme activity; activators are molecules that increase activity. Many drugs and poisons are enzyme inhibitors. Activity is also affected by temperature, pressure, chemical environment, and the concentration of substrate. Some enzymes are used commercially, for example, in the synthesis of antibiotics. In addition, some household products use enzymes to speed up biochemical reactions (e.g. , enzymes in biological washing powders break down protein or fat stains on clothes; enzymes in meat tenderizers break down proteins into smaller molecules, making the meat easier to chew).@en"><resourceType>Freebase:/chemistry/chemical_classification</resourceType><resourceType>Freebase:/chemistry</resourceType><resourceType>DBpedia:TopicalConcept</resourceType></type:DbpediaAnnotation><type:DbpediaAnnotation xmi:id="9610" sofa="12" begin="41039" end="41044" componentId="System-dbpedia-spotlight" Uri="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brain" similarityScore="0.05020182952284813" abstract="The brain is the center of the nervous system in all vertebrate and most invertebrate animals—only a few invertebrates such as sponges, jellyfish, adult sea squirts and starfish do not have one, even if diffuse neural tissue is present. It is located in the head, usually close to the primary sensory organs for such senses as vision, hearing, balance, taste, and smell. The brain of a vertebrate is the most complex organ of its body. In a typical human the cerebral cortex (the largest part) is estimated to contain 15–33 billion neurons, each connected by synapses to several thousand other neurons. These neurons communicate with one another by means of long protoplasmic fibers called axons, which carry trains of signal pulses called action potentials to distant parts of the brain or body targeting specific recipient cells. Physiologically, the function of the brain is to exert centralized control over the other organs of the body. The brain acts on the rest of the body both by generating patterns of muscle activity and by driving secretion of chemicals called hormones. This centralized control allows rapid and coordinated responses to changes in the environment. Some basic types of responsiveness such as reflexes can be mediated by the spinal cord or peripheral ganglia, but sophisticated purposeful control of behavior based on complex sensory input requires the information-integrating capabilities of a centralized brain. From a philosophical point of view, what makes the brain special in comparison to other organs is that it forms the physical structure that generates the mind. As Hippocrates put it: &quot;Men ought to know that from nothing else but the brain come joys, delights, laughter and sports, and sorrows, griefs, despondency, and lamentations. &quot; Through much of history, the mind was thought to be separate from the brain. Even for present-day neuroscience, the mechanisms by which brain activity gives rise to consciousness and thought remain very challenging to understand: despite rapid scientific progress, much about how the brain works remains a mystery. The operations of individual brain cells are now understood in considerable detail, but the way they cooperate in ensembles of millions has been very difficult to decipher. The most promising approaches treat the brain as a biological computer, very different in mechanism from electronic computers, but similar in the sense that it acquires information from the surrounding world, stores it, and processes it in a variety of ways. This article compares the properties of brains across the entire range of animal species, with the greatest attention to vertebrates. It deals with the human brain insofar as it shares the properties of other brains. The ways in which the human brain differs from other brains are covered in the human brain article. Several topics that might be covered here are instead covered there because much more can be said about them in a human context. The most important is brain disease and the effects of brain damage, covered in the human brain article because the most common diseases of the human brain either do not show up in other species, or else manifest themselves in different ways.@en"><resourceType>Freebase:/medicine/anatomical_structure</resourceType><resourceType>Freebase:/medicine</resourceType><resourceType>Freebase:/book/book_subject</resourceType><resourceType>Freebase:/book</resourceType><resourceType>DBpedia:TopicalConcept</resourceType></type:DbpediaAnnotation><type:DbpediaAnnotation xmi:id="9635" sofa="12" begin="41433" end="41438" componentId="System-dbpedia-spotlight" Uri="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cell_%28biology%29" similarityScore="0.13335959613323212"><resourceType>DBpedia:TopicalConcept</resourceType></type:DbpediaAnnotation><type:DbpediaAnnotation xmi:id="9648" sofa="12" begin="41505" end="41510" componentId="System-dbpedia-spotlight" Uri="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cell_%28biology%29" similarityScore="0.13335959613323212"><resourceType>DBpedia:TopicalConcept</resourceType></type:DbpediaAnnotation><type:DbpediaAnnotation xmi:id="9661" sofa="12" begin="41769" end="41774" componentId="System-dbpedia-spotlight" Uri="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cell_%28biology%29" similarityScore="0.13335959613323212"><resourceType>DBpedia:TopicalConcept</resourceType></type:DbpediaAnnotation><type:DbpediaAnnotation xmi:id="9674" sofa="12" begin="41805" end="41808" componentId="System-dbpedia-spotlight" Uri="http://dbpedia.org/resource/DNA" similarityScore="0.06963567435741425" abstract="Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a molecule that encodes the genetic instructions used in the development and functioning of all known living organisms and many viruses.

These products are often proteins, but in non-protein coding genes such as ribosomal RNA (rRNA), transfer RNA (tRNA) or small nuclear RNA (snRNA) genes, the product is a functional RNA. The process of gene expression is used by all known life - eukaryotes, prokaryotes, possibly induced by viruses - to generate the macromolecular machinery for life. Several steps in the gene expression process may be modulated, including the transcription, RNA splicing, translation, and post-translational modification of a protein. Gene regulation gives the cell control over structure and function, and is the basis for cellular differentiation, morphogenesis and the versatility and adaptability of any organism. Gene regulation may also serve as a substrate for evolutionary change, since control of the timing, location, and amount of gene expression can have a profound effect on the functions (actions) of the gene in a cell or in a multicellular organism. In genetics, gene expression is the most fundamental level at which the genotype gives rise to the phenotype. The genetic code stored in DNA is &quot;interpreted&quot; by gene expression, and the properties of the expression give rise to the organism's phenotype.

These products are often proteins, but in non-protein coding genes such as ribosomal RNA (rRNA), transfer RNA (tRNA) or small nuclear RNA (snRNA) genes, the product is a functional RNA. The process of gene expression is used by all known life - eukaryotes, prokaryotes, possibly induced by viruses - to generate the macromolecular machinery for life. Several steps in the gene expression process may be modulated, including the transcription, RNA splicing, translation, and post-translational modification of a protein. Gene regulation gives the cell control over structure and function, and is the basis for cellular differentiation, morphogenesis and the versatility and adaptability of any organism. Gene regulation may also serve as a substrate for evolutionary change, since control of the timing, location, and amount of gene expression can have a profound effect on the functions (actions) of the gene in a cell or in a multicellular organism.

The antibody recognizes a unique part of the foreign target, called an antigen. Each tip of the &quot;Y&quot; of an antibody contains a paratope (a structure analogous to a lock) that is specific for one particular epitope (similarly analogous to a key) on an antigen, allowing these two structures to bind together with precision. Using this binding mechanism, an antibody can tag a microbe or an infected cell for attack by other parts of the immune system, or can neutralize its target directly (for example, by blocking a part of a microbe that is essential for its invasion and survival). The production of antibodies is the main function of the humoral immune system. Antibodies are secreted by a type of white blood cell called a plasma cell. Antibodies can occur in two physical forms, a soluble form that is secreted from the cell, and a membrane-bound form that is attached to the surface of a B cell and is referred to as the B cell receptor (BCR). The BCR is only found on the surface of B cells and facilitates the activation of these cells and their subsequent differentiation into either antibody factories called plasma cells, or memory B cells that will survive in the body and remember that same antigen so the B cells can respond faster upon future exposure. In most cases, interaction of the B cell with a T helper cell is necessary to produce full activation of the B cell and, therefore, antibody generation following antigen binding. Soluble antibodies are released into the blood and tissue fluids, as well as many secretions to continue to survey for invading microorganisms. Antibodies are glycoproteins belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily; the terms antibody and immunoglobulin are often used interchangeably. Antibodies are typically made of basic structural units—each with two large heavy chains and two small light chains. There are several different types of antibody heavy chains, and several different kinds of antibodies, which are grouped into different isotypes based on which heavy chain they possess. Five different antibody isotypes are known in mammals, which perform different roles, and help direct the appropriate immune response for each different type of foreign object they encounter. Though the general structure of all antibodies is very similar, a small region at the tip of the protein is extremely variable, allowing millions of antibodies with slightly different tip structures, or antigen binding sites, to exist. This region is known as the hypervariable region. Each of these variants can bind to a different antigen. This enormous diversity of antibodies allows the immune system to recognize an equally wide variety of antigens. The large and diverse population of antibodies is generated by random combinations of a set of gene segments that encode different antigen binding sites (or paratopes), followed by random mutations in this area of the antibody gene, which create further diversity. Antibody genes also re-organize in a process called class switching that changes the base of the heavy chain to another, creating a different isotype of the antibody that retains the antigen specific variable region.

For other uses, see Gene (disambiguation). A gene is a molecular unit of heredity of a living organism. It is widely accepted by the scientific community as a name given to some stretches of DNA and RNA that code for a polypeptide or for an RNA chain that has a function in the organism, though there still are controversies about what plays the role of the genetic material. Living beings depend on genes, as they specify all proteins and functional RNA chains. Genes hold the information to build and maintain an organism's cells and pass genetic traits to offspring. All organisms have many genes corresponding to various biological traits, some of which are immediately visible, such as eye color or number of limbs, and some of which are not, such as blood type, increased risk for specific diseases, or the thousands of basic biochemical processes that comprise life. A modern working definition of a gene is &quot;a locatable region of genomic sequence, corresponding to a unit of inheritance, which is associated with regulatory regions, transcribed regions, and or other functional sequence regions &quot;. Colloquial usage of the term gene (e.g. &quot;good genes&quot;, &quot;hair color gene&quot;) may actually refer to an allele: a gene is the basic instruction—a sequence of nucleic acids (DNA or, in the case of certain viruses RNA), while an allele is one variant of that gene. Thus, when the mainstream press refers to &quot;having&quot; a &quot;gene&quot; for a specific trait, this is generally inaccurate. In most cases, all people would have a gene for the trait in question, but certain people will have a specific allele of that gene, which results in the trait variant. Further, genes code for proteins, which might result in identifiable traits, but it is the gene, not the trait, which is inherited.@en"><resourceType>DBpedia:TopicalConcept</resourceType></type:DbpediaAnnotation><type:DbpediaAnnotation xmi:id="10327" sofa="12" begin="51819" end="51823" componentId="System-dbpedia-spotlight" Uri="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cell_%28biology%29" similarityScore="0.13335959613323212"><resourceType>DBpedia:TopicalConcept</resourceType></type:DbpediaAnnotation><type:DbpediaAnnotation xmi:id="10340" sofa="12" begin="51824" end="51831" componentId="System-dbpedia-spotlight" Uri="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Protein" similarityScore="0.089495949447155" abstract="Proteins are large biological molecules consisting of one or more chains of amino acids.

A polypeptide is a single linear polymer chain of amino acids bonded together by peptide bonds between the carboxyl and amino groups of adjacent amino acid residues. The sequence of amino acids in a protein is defined by the sequence of a gene, which is encoded in the genetic code. In general, the genetic code specifies 20 standard amino acids; however, in certain organisms the genetic code can include selenocysteine and—in certain archaea—pyrrolysine. Shortly after or even during synthesis, the residues in a protein are often chemically modified by posttranslational modification, which alters the physical and chemical properties, folding, stability, activity, and ultimately, the function of the proteins. Sometimes proteins have non-peptide groups attached, which can be called prosthetic groups or cofactors. Proteins can also work together to achieve a particular function, and they often associate to form stable protein complexes. Like other biological macromolecules such as polysaccharides and nucleic acids, proteins are essential parts of organisms and participate in virtually every process within cells. Many proteins are enzymes that catalyze biochemical reactions and are vital to metabolism. Proteins also have structural or mechanical functions, such as actin and myosin in muscle and the proteins in the cytoskeleton, which form a system of scaffolding that maintains cell shape. Other proteins are important in cell signaling, immune responses, cell adhesion, and the cell cycle. Proteins are also necessary in animals' diets, since animals cannot synthesize all the amino acids they need and must obtain essential amino acids from food. Through the process of digestion, animals break down ingested protein into free amino acids that are then used in metabolism. Proteins may be purified from other cellular components using a variety of techniques such as ultracentrifugation, precipitation, electrophoresis, and chromatography; the advent of genetic engineering has made possible a number of methods to facilitate purification.

The main biological functions of lipids include energy storage, signaling, and acting as structural components of cell membranes. Lipids have found applications in cosmetic and food industries as well as in nanotechnology. Lipids may be broadly defined as hydrophobic or amphiphilic small molecules; the amphiphilic nature of some lipids allows them to form structures such as vesicles, liposomes, or membranes in an aqueous environment. Biological lipids originate entirely or in part from two distinct types of biochemical subunits or &quot;building-blocks&quot;: ketoacyl and isoprene groups. Using this approach, lipids may be divided into eight categories: fatty acids, glycerolipids, glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids, saccharolipids, and polyketides (derived from condensation of ketoacyl subunits); and sterol lipids and prenol lipids (derived from condensation of isoprene subunits). Although the term lipid is sometimes used as a synonym for fats, fats are a subgroup of lipids called triglycerides. Lipids also encompass molecules such as fatty acids and their derivatives, as well as other sterol-containing metabolites such as cholesterol. Although humans and other mammals use various biosynthetic pathways to both break down and synthesize lipids, some essential lipids cannot be made this way and must be obtained from the diet.@en"><resourceType>Freebase:/food/nutrient</resourceType><resourceType>Freebase:/food</resourceType><resourceType>Freebase:/book/book_subject</resourceType><resourceType>Freebase:/book</resourceType></type:DbpediaAnnotation><type:DbpediaAnnotation xmi:id="10450" sofa="12" begin="52775" end="52782" componentId="System-dbpedia-spotlight" Uri="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Protein" similarityScore="0.089495949447155" abstract="Proteins are large biological molecules consisting of one or more chains of amino acids.

The antibody recognizes a unique part of the foreign target, called an antigen.

Using this binding mechanism, an antibody can tag a microbe or an infected cell for attack by other parts of the immune system, or can neutralize its target directly (for example, by blocking a part of a microbe that is essential for its invasion and survival). The production of antibodies is the main function of the humoral immune system. Antibodies are secreted by a type of white blood cell called a plasma cell. Antibodies can occur in two physical forms, a soluble form that is secreted from the cell, and a membrane-bound form that is attached to the surface of a B cell and is referred to as the B cell receptor (BCR).

The sequence of amino acids in a protein is defined by the sequence of a gene, which is encoded in the genetic code. In general, the genetic code specifies 20 standard amino acids; however, in certain organisms the genetic code can include selenocysteine and—in certain archaea—pyrrolysine. Shortly after or even during synthesis, the residues in a protein are often chemically modified by posttranslational modification, which alters the physical and chemical properties, folding, stability, activity, and ultimately, the function of the proteins. Sometimes proteins have non-peptide groups attached, which can be called prosthetic groups or cofactors. Proteins can also work together to achieve a particular function, and they often associate to form stable protein complexes. Like other biological macromolecules such as polysaccharides and nucleic acids, proteins are essential parts of organisms and participate in virtually every process within cells. Many proteins are enzymes that catalyze biochemical reactions and are vital to metabolism. Proteins also have structural or mechanical functions, such as actin and myosin in muscle and the proteins in the cytoskeleton, which form a system of scaffolding that maintains cell shape. Other proteins are important in cell signaling, immune responses, cell adhesion, and the cell cycle. Proteins are also necessary in animals' diets, since animals cannot synthesize all the amino acids they need and must obtain essential amino acids from food. Through the process of digestion, animals break down ingested protein into free amino acids that are then used in metabolism. Proteins may be purified from other cellular components using a variety of techniques such as ultracentrifugation, precipitation, electrophoresis, and chromatography; the advent of genetic engineering has made possible a number of methods to facilitate purification.

It is located in the head, usually close to the primary sensory organs for such senses as vision, hearing, balance, taste, and smell. The brain of a vertebrate is the most complex organ of its body. In a typical human the cerebral cortex (the largest part) is estimated to contain 15–33 billion neurons, each connected by synapses to several thousand other neurons. These neurons communicate with one another by means of long protoplasmic fibers called axons, which carry trains of signal pulses called action potentials to distant parts of the brain or body targeting specific recipient cells. Physiologically, the function of the brain is to exert centralized control over the other organs of the body. The brain acts on the rest of the body both by generating patterns of muscle activity and by driving secretion of chemicals called hormones. This centralized control allows rapid and coordinated responses to changes in the environment. Some basic types of responsiveness such as reflexes can be mediated by the spinal cord or peripheral ganglia, but sophisticated purposeful control of behavior based on complex sensory input requires the information-integrating capabilities of a centralized brain. From a philosophical point of view, what makes the brain special in comparison to other organs is that it forms the physical structure that generates the mind. As Hippocrates put it: &quot;Men ought to know that from nothing else but the brain come joys, delights, laughter and sports, and sorrows, griefs, despondency, and lamentations. &quot; Through much of history, the mind was thought to be separate from the brain. Even for present-day neuroscience, the mechanisms by which brain activity gives rise to consciousness and thought remain very challenging to understand: despite rapid scientific progress, much about how the brain works remains a mystery. The operations of individual brain cells are now understood in considerable detail, but the way they cooperate in ensembles of millions has been very difficult to decipher. The most promising approaches treat the brain as a biological computer, very different in mechanism from electronic computers, but similar in the sense that it acquires information from the surrounding world, stores it, and processes it in a variety of ways. This article compares the properties of brains across the entire range of animal species, with the greatest attention to vertebrates. It deals with the human brain insofar as it shares the properties of other brains. The ways in which the human brain differs from other brains are covered in the human brain article. Several topics that might be covered here are instead covered there because much more can be said about them in a human context. The most important is brain disease and the effects of brain damage, covered in the human brain article because the most common diseases of the human brain either do not show up in other species, or else manifest themselves in different ways.@en"><resourceType>Freebase:/medicine/anatomical_structure</resourceType><resourceType>Freebase:/medicine</resourceType><resourceType>Freebase:/book/book_subject</resourceType><resourceType>Freebase:/book</resourceType><resourceType>DBpedia:TopicalConcept</resourceType></type:DbpediaAnnotation><type:DbpediaAnnotation xmi:id="10811" sofa="12" begin="57221" end="57232" componentId="System-dbpedia-spotlight" Uri="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cholesterol" similarityScore="0.0465526208281517" abstract="Cholesterol, from the Greek chole- and stereos (solid) followed by the chemical suffix -ol for an alcohol, is an organic molecule.

A chemical signal occurs via a synapse, a specialized connection with other cells. Neurons connect to each other to form neural networks. Neurons are the core components of the nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral ganglia. A number of specialized types of neurons exist: sensory neurons respond to touch, sound, light and numerous other stimuli affecting cells of the sensory organs that then send signals to the spinal cord and brain. Motor neurons receive signals from the brain and spinal cord, cause muscle contractions, and affect glands. Interneurons connect neurons to other neurons within the same region of the brain or spinal cord. A typical neuron possesses a cell body (often called the soma), dendrites, and an axon. Dendrites are thin structures that arise from the cell body, often extending for hundreds of micrometres and branching multiple times, giving rise to a complex &quot;dendritic tree&quot;. An axon is a special cellular extension that arises from the cell body at a site called the axon hillock and travels for a distance, as far as 1 meter in humans or even more in other species. The cell body of a neuron frequently gives rise to multiple dendrites, but never to more than one axon, although the axon may branch hundreds of times before it terminates. At the majority of synapses, signals are sent from the axon of one neuron to a dendrite of another. There are, however, many exceptions to these rules: neurons that lack dendrites, neurons that have no axon, synapses that connect an axon to another axon or a dendrite to another dendrite, etc. All neurons are electrically excitable, maintaining voltage gradients across their membranes by means of metabolically driven ion pumps, which combine with ion channels embedded in the membrane to generate intracellular-versus-extracellular concentration differences of ions such as sodium, potassium, chloride, and calcium. Changes in the cross-membrane voltage can alter the function of voltage-dependent ion channels. If the voltage changes by a large enough amount, an all-or-none electrochemical pulse called an action potential is generated, which travels rapidly along the cell's axon, and activates synaptic connections with other cells when it arrives. Neurons do not undergo cell division. In most cases, neurons are generated by special types of stem cells. Astrocytes, a type of glial cell, have also been observed to turn into neurons by virtue of the stem cell characteristic pluripotency.

These products are often proteins, but in non-protein coding genes such as ribosomal RNA (rRNA), transfer RNA (tRNA) or small nuclear RNA (snRNA) genes, the product is a functional RNA. The process of gene expression is used by all known life - eukaryotes, prokaryotes, possibly induced by viruses - to generate the macromolecular machinery for life. Several steps in the gene expression process may be modulated, including the transcription, RNA splicing, translation, and post-translational modification of a protein. Gene regulation gives the cell control over structure and function, and is the basis for cellular differentiation, morphogenesis and the versatility and adaptability of any organism. Gene regulation may also serve as a substrate for evolutionary change, since control of the timing, location, and amount of gene expression can have a profound effect on the functions (actions) of the gene in a cell or in a multicellular organism. In genetics, gene expression is the most fundamental level at which the genotype gives rise to the phenotype. The genetic code stored in DNA is &quot;interpreted&quot; by gene expression, and the properties of the expression give rise to the organism's phenotype.

In humans, neurogenesis largely ceases during adulthood—but in two brain areas, the hippocampus and olfactory bulb, there is strong evidence for generation of substantial numbers of new neurons.@en"><resourceType>Freebase:/award/award_winning_work</resourceType><resourceType>Freebase:/award</resourceType><resourceType>Freebase:/medicine/anatomical_structure</resourceType><resourceType>Freebase:/medicine</resourceType></type:DbpediaAnnotation><type:DbpediaAnnotation xmi:id="11050" sofa="12" begin="64071" end="64078" componentId="System-dbpedia-spotlight" Uri="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peptide" similarityScore="0.06371808797121048" abstract="Peptides (from Gr. πεπτός, &quot;digested&quot;, derived from πέσσειν, &quot;to digest&quot;) are short chains of amino acid monomers linked by peptide bonds, the covalent chemical bonds formed when the carboxyl group of one amino acid reacts with the amino group of another.

Mutations may or may not produce discernable changes in the observable characteristics of an organism. Mutations play a part in both normal and abnormal biological processes, including evolution, cancer, and the development of the immune system. Mutation can result in several different types of change in sequences; these can either have no effect, alter the product of a gene, or prevent the gene from functioning properly or completely. One study on genetic variations between different species of Drosophila suggests that if a mutation changes a protein produced by a gene, the result is likely to be harmful, with an estimated 70 percent of amino acid polymorphisms having damaging effects, and the remainder being either neutral or weakly beneficial.

The process of gene expression is used by all known life - eukaryotes, prokaryotes, possibly induced by viruses - to generate the macromolecular machinery for life. Several steps in the gene expression process may be modulated, including the transcription, RNA splicing, translation, and post-translational modification of a protein. Gene regulation gives the cell control over structure and function, and is the basis for cellular differentiation, morphogenesis and the versatility and adaptability of any organism. Gene regulation may also serve as a substrate for evolutionary change, since control of the timing, location, and amount of gene expression can have a profound effect on the functions (actions) of the gene in a cell or in a multicellular organism. In genetics, gene expression is the most fundamental level at which the genotype gives rise to the phenotype. The genetic code stored in DNA is &quot;interpreted&quot; by gene expression, and the properties of the expression give rise to the organism's phenotype.

The key elements of an amino acid are carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen, though other elements are found in the side-chains of certain amino acids. About 500 amino acids are known and can be classified in many ways. Structurally they can be classified according to the functional groups' locations as alpha- (α-), beta- (β-), gamma- (γ-) or delta- (δ-) amino acids; other categories relate to polarity, pH level, and side chain group type (aliphatic, acyclic, aromatic, containing hydroxyl or sulphur, et al.). In the form of proteins, amino acids comprise the second largest component of human muscles, cells and other tissues. Outside proteins, amino acids perform critical roles in processes such as neurotransmitter transport and biosynthesis. Amino acids having both the amine and carboxylic acid groups attached to the first (alpha-) carbon atom have particular importance in biochemistry. They are known as 2-, alpha-, or α-amino acids (generic formula H2NCHRCOOH in most cases where R is an organic substituent known as a &quot;side-chain&quot;); often the term &quot;amino acid&quot; is used to refer specifically to these. They include the 23 proteinogenic (&quot;protein-building&quot;) amino acids which combine into peptide chains (&quot;polypeptides&quot;) to form the building blocks of a vast array of proteins. These are all L-stereoisomers although a few D-amino acids (&quot;right-handed&quot;) occur in bacterial envelopes and some antibiotics. 20 of the 23 proteinogenic amino acids are encoded directly by triplet codons in the genetic code and are known as &quot;standard&quot; amino acids. The other three (&quot;non-standard&quot; or &quot;non-canonical&quot;) are pyrrolysine, selenocysteine (present in many noneukaryotes as well as most eukaryotes), and N-Formylmethionine. For example, 25 human proteins include selenocysteine (Sec) in their primary structure, and the structurally characterized enzymes (selenoenzymes) employ Sec as the catalytic moiety in their active sites. Pyrollysine and selenocysteine are encoded via variant codons; for example, selenocysteine is encoded by stop codon and SECIS element. Codon–tRNA combinations not found in nature can also be used to &quot;expand&quot; the genetic code and create novel proteins known as alloproteins incorporating non-proteinogenic amino acids. Many important proteinogenic and non-proteinogenic amino acids also play critical non-protein roles within the body. For example: in the human brain, glutamate and gamma-amino-butyric acid (&quot;GABA&quot;, non-standard gamma-amino acid) are respectively the main excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters; hydroxyproline is synthesised from proline; the standard amino acid glycine is used to synthesise porphyrins used in red blood cells; and the non-standard carnitine is used in lipid transport. 9 of the 20 standard amino acids are called &quot;essential&quot; for humans because they cannot be created from other compounds by the human body, and so must be taken in as food. Others may be conditionally essential for certain ages or medical conditions. Essential amino acids may also differ between species. Because of their biological significance, amino acids are important in nutrition and are commonly used in nutritional supplements, fertilizers, and food technology. Industrial uses include the production of drugs, biodegradable plastics and chiral catalysts.@en"><resourceType>Freebase:/chemistry/chemical_classification</resourceType><resourceType>Freebase:/chemistry</resourceType></type:DbpediaAnnotation><type:DbpediaAnnotation xmi:id="11319" sofa="12" begin="66175" end="66182" componentId="System-dbpedia-spotlight" Uri="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Protein" similarityScore="0.1939101666212082" abstract="Proteins are large biological molecules consisting of one or more chains of amino acids.

When the diversity of required support roles exceeds the resources of the sponsor, a clinical trial is managed by an outsourced partner, such as a contract research organization or a clinical trials unit in the academic sector.@en"><resourceType>Freebase:/book/book_subject</resourceType><resourceType>Freebase:/book</resourceType></type:DbpediaAnnotation><type:DbpediaAnnotation xmi:id="11416" sofa="12" begin="66542" end="66550" componentId="System-dbpedia-spotlight" Uri="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mutation" similarityScore="0.14221817255020142" abstract="In genetics, a mutation is a change of the nucleotide sequence of the genome of an organism, virus, or extrachromosomal genetic element.

Proteins perform a vast array of functions within living organisms, including catalyzing metabolic reactions, replicating DNA, responding to stimuli, and transporting molecules from one location to another. Proteins differ from one another primarily in their sequence of amino acids, which is dictated by the nucleotide sequence of their genes, and which usually results in folding of the protein into a specific three-dimensional structure that determines its activity. A polypeptide is a single linear polymer chain of amino acids bonded together by peptide bonds between the carboxyl and amino groups of adjacent amino acid residues. The sequence of amino acids in a protein is defined by the sequence of a gene, which is encoded in the genetic code. In general, the genetic code specifies 20 standard amino acids; however, in certain organisms the genetic code can include selenocysteine and—in certain archaea—pyrrolysine. Shortly after or even during synthesis, the residues in a protein are often chemically modified by posttranslational modification, which alters the physical and chemical properties, folding, stability, activity, and ultimately, the function of the proteins. Sometimes proteins have non-peptide groups attached, which can be called prosthetic groups or cofactors. Proteins can also work together to achieve a particular function, and they often associate to form stable protein complexes. Like other biological macromolecules such as polysaccharides and nucleic acids, proteins are essential parts of organisms and participate in virtually every process within cells. Many proteins are enzymes that catalyze biochemical reactions and are vital to metabolism. Proteins also have structural or mechanical functions, such as actin and myosin in muscle and the proteins in the cytoskeleton, which form a system of scaffolding that maintains cell shape. Other proteins are important in cell signaling, immune responses, cell adhesion, and the cell cycle. Proteins are also necessary in animals' diets, since animals cannot synthesize all the amino acids they need and must obtain essential amino acids from food. Through the process of digestion, animals break down ingested protein into free amino acids that are then used in metabolism. Proteins may be purified from other cellular components using a variety of techniques such as ultracentrifugation, precipitation, electrophoresis, and chromatography; the advent of genetic engineering has made possible a number of methods to facilitate purification. Methods commonly used to study protein structure and function include immunohistochemistry, site-directed mutagenesis, nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry.@en"><resourceType>Freebase:/chemistry/chemical_classification</resourceType><resourceType>Freebase:/chemistry</resourceType><resourceType>Freebase:/food/nutrient</resourceType><resourceType>Freebase:/food</resourceType><resourceType>Freebase:/book/book_subject</resourceType><resourceType>Freebase:/book</resourceType></type:DbpediaAnnotation><type:DbpediaAnnotation xmi:id="11478" sofa="12" begin="66685" end="66694" componentId="System-dbpedia-spotlight" Uri="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mutation" similarityScore="0.17634575068950653" abstract="In genetics, a mutation is a change of the nucleotide sequence of the genome of an organism, virus, or extrachromosomal genetic element.

For other uses, see Gene (disambiguation). A gene is a molecular unit of heredity of a living organism. It is widely accepted by the scientific community as a name given to some stretches of DNA and RNA that code for a polypeptide or for an RNA chain that has a function in the organism, though there still are controversies about what plays the role of the genetic material. Living beings depend on genes, as they specify all proteins and functional RNA chains. Genes hold the information to build and maintain an organism's cells and pass genetic traits to offspring. All organisms have many genes corresponding to various biological traits, some of which are immediately visible, such as eye color or number of limbs, and some of which are not, such as blood type, increased risk for specific diseases, or the thousands of basic biochemical processes that comprise life. A modern working definition of a gene is &quot;a locatable region of genomic sequence, corresponding to a unit of inheritance, which is associated with regulatory regions, transcribed regions, and or other functional sequence regions &quot;. Colloquial usage of the term gene (e.g. &quot;good genes&quot;, &quot;hair color gene&quot;) may actually refer to an allele: a gene is the basic instruction—a sequence of nucleic acids (DNA or, in the case of certain viruses RNA), while an allele is one variant of that gene. Thus, when the mainstream press refers to &quot;having&quot; a &quot;gene&quot; for a specific trait, this is generally inaccurate. In most cases, all people would have a gene for the trait in question, but certain people will have a specific allele of that gene, which results in the trait variant. Further, genes code for proteins, which might result in identifiable traits, but it is the gene, not the trait, which is inherited.@en"><resourceType>DBpedia:TopicalConcept</resourceType></type:DbpediaAnnotation><type:DbpediaAnnotation xmi:id="11583" sofa="12" begin="65400" end="65409" componentId="System-dbpedia-spotlight" Uri="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mutation" similarityScore="0.12382378429174423" abstract="In genetics, a mutation is a change of the nucleotide sequence of the genome of an organism, virus, or extrachromosomal genetic element.

Over the last 40 years biochemistry has become so successful at explaining living processes that now almost all areas of the life sciences from botany to medicine are engaged in biochemical research. Today the main focus of pure biochemistry is in understanding how biological molecules give rise to the processes that occur within living cells, which in turn relates greatly to the study and understanding of whole organisms. Biochemistry is closely related to molecular biology, the study of the molecular mechanisms by which genetic information encoded in DNA is able to result in the processes of life. Depending on the exact definition of the terms used, molecular biology can be thought of as a branch of biochemistry, or biochemistry as a tool with which to investigate and study molecular biology. Much of biochemistry deals with the structures, functions and interactions of biological macromolecules, such as proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates and lipids, which provide the structure of cells and perform many of the functions associated with life. The chemistry of the cell also depends on the reactions of smaller molecules and ions. These can be inorganic, for example water and metal ions, or organic, for example the amino acids which are used to synthesise proteins.
